# Part 3

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

After the lunch on the ninety-fifth floor was over, Ронье returned to her room on the twenty-second floor и caught her best friend trying to enter her bedroom through the shared living room.

"So, Тейза, how to make that small book that you were using right now......."

"Notebook"

"Eh?"

"Я will not call it a book anymore, instead Я will call it notebook in a sacred language. This name is short и fits it so well."

While she said so, Тейза took out the notebook from her pocket, и Ронье upturned her eyes.

"...... What, Ронье, why such a face?"

"No, that's OK, but.... when you use so many sacred words, more than Дюсольберт-сама does for instance, or other young people do...... that just feels weird."

"Then we can tell the teacher as well."

"It’s not what I....... ── Anyway, let me know how to make it."

This way Ронье felt that she falls more и more behind her best friend by the knowledge of the general purpose Sacred Language, so she insisted. Grinning Тейза held the notebook on her chest with both hands.

"Of course, Я can, but you know, it was quite a challenge to bind all these thick white hemp paper sheets..."

"... Я understood. A raspberry tart of «honey’s» candy store."

"Deal."

Having nodded with a serious face, Тейза took a folded piece of paper out of the other side pocket. It was not a white hemp paper but a regular one because of its thinness и hue, и it was covered with neat small letters.

"Here, kind Тейза has written how to make a note for poor Ронье. The most important thing is to use thin и durable yarn."

"....... th-thanks......."

Ронье received it with a bit of surprise. Perhaps, Тейза had made this memorandum — which should be “**memo**” in the Sacred Language — for Ронье long ago.

"Thank you, Тейза."

Ронье firmly grabbed her best friend's right hand with both hands, thanking her again, properly this time. In response, Тейза smiled embarrassingly и blinked both eyes.

After obtaining the manufacturing method, she would surely want to go to the paper factory in the corner of the twelfth floor of the Собора right away to pick some discarded white paper, but that unfortunately had to be postponed. Having changed in the bedroom into a knight outfit for going out и wearing a gray cloak, Ронье went down the big stairs with Тейза who had the same look.

The left through the front door of the first floor, и the afternoon sun gently caressed the skin. It was February so the wind was still cold but they almost could feel how it gets warmer little by little every day.

Away from the front square neatly decorated with pure white tiles, cutting through the front grass lawn in the southwest direction. Usually, they would go to Цукигаке и Шимосаки in the dragon stables и stay with them till evening, but that day dragons had to wait a little more. Because they two of them had an important task to do.

Proceeding ahead, one could see as the spacious front yard is changed to orchards, with lined-up trees. Although most of the trees have dropped leaves in this season и the middle of winter is not rich in fruit, still there were many seasonal black apples и ice figs, spreading around faint sweet scent.

They just had a good lunch, but still unusual transparent light blue fig fruits sparkled a desire to eat at least one... и as they passed through the orchard withstanding the temptation, a huge wall became visible up ahead. This marble wall divided the grounds of the Axiom Church Центрального Собора from the outside world.

There were already figures of Кирито и Асуна near the corner where the south wall met the west wall.

The two of them wrapped in plain brown cloaks gently raised their hands when they noticed girls. Ронье и Тейза rushed through the last few tens of mel, stopped at the same time и lowered their heads.

"We’re sorry, we kept you waiting."

"It’s nothing, we also just came here."

Кирито grinned и added to Асуна’s words.

"We jumped off the Собора и saw Ронье и Тейза as we were going down."

Apparently, Кирито overtook them by the sky using his incarnational flight technique. One day Ронье already caught a glimpse of the surroundings from that height, even though she still couldn’t learn how to do an incarnational flight with aerial elements.

"So... why is this a meeting place?"

The destination of the four of them was the South Центория city, и one had to go through the main gate in the middle of the southern wall to get there. But in this place where white marble walls joined at the right angle, there was no such thing as a passageway.

*Perhaps, there is a hidden door we do not know about*...... as she was guessing, Кирито shrugged и answered.

"The opening и closing of the main gate is conspicuous....... It is absolutely impossible to sneak in и out unnoticed because there are lots of tourists at this time in the square beyond the gate."

"Then, how about flying like before?"

There was some hope in the voice Тейза said that with. Certainly, four days ago, when they heard that a murder happened in South Центория, Кирито jumped out of the terrace at the top of the Собора with Ронье on his left side as he was и went straight to the site by aerial element flight technique. The journey took just several tens of seconds, plus flying in the sky was a very exciting experience. It was natural for Тейза to expect something — but.

"Well, that'd be so conspicuous...."

While smiling wryly, Кирито added quickly:

"But today Я think we will try a secret shortcut."

"Se...... secret shortcut?"

Тейза made round eyes suggesting that she was not disappointed. Премьер-Мечник who changed the smile to a mischievous one lifted both hands without further explanation.

"Well, let's hold the hands, the four of us."

"............?"

Tilting her head a little, Ронье grasped Кирито's left hand и Тейза's took the right one. From the other side, Асуна took their hands и gave a slight nod, и four people formed a small circle.

Immediately afterwards, the green light blinked in the center of the circle continuously и the intense wind bounced the grass radially under their legs. Unexpectedly, Ронье's body suddenly raised with the poser of wind pressure coming directly from below.

"Wa! Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa..!"

Тейза shouted и began flipping both feet in the air. However, their bodies did not return to the ground и continued rising at about 1 mel per second.

Ронье, who was used to Кирито's ways a little bit better than her best friend, breathed deeply at the beginning of this new experience, but there was a chance to observe the situation. Beneath their bodies, the air was continuously released, creating a strong wind, but the crowns of the nearby trees were only moved with the natural breeze. If you look closely, there was a faint rainbow-colored light swirling just outside the four people. Someone — probably Кирито, created a cylindrical transparent wall around four people with the application of the Knight's secret "arm of mind" technique, which blocked the wind, so the freed aerial elements created a strong air current raising Ронье и others up vertically. In other words, in principle it worked in the same way as the elevator in Собора.

Тейза, who was scared, seemed to regain the control in less than ten seconds, и watched the area a while swaying her cheering face from one side to another.

"Ah, it’s amazing, I’m flying, Ронье!"

"Hey Тейза, do not let go of my hand!"

Ронье grabbed the hand of his best friend even firmer, и the four people continued to rise increasing speed little by little. The ground was already far down, but the white wall blocking the overview still didn’t finish. Looking up, the top of the wall drawing a straight line in the light blue winter sky was still terribly far away.

*If Кирито-сенпай's ability to concentrate or the spatial divine powers turns out to be not enough, Я wonder what will happen*... she forcibly interrupted the imagination и continued to glare at the top. The rise lasted for about 20 seconds, at the end they flew somewhat diagonally и finally crossed the edge of the wall.

Immediately afterwards, the wind pressure momentarily disappeared, и four people fell from about 2 mel. Girls could never imagine that practicing "Standing straight on the top of a pillar" would do any good, but this time there was not enough power to support her legs, и together with Тейза who stumbled upon landing, Ронье almost fell on her back.

But before she did, Кирито's right hand slightly supported her, и as soon as he saw the surroundings, Ронье let out a sound of astonishment.

"Wow............"

Speaking of the height, it was about the tenth floor of Собора — at most 50 mel. However, from the position they were the cityscape of Центория, spreading to where the eye can reach, till it looked distant и hazy. There was more. From the junction of the southern wall и the western wall where the four of them were standing, the wall of the same height extended straight in the southwest direction.

"...... Here we are on the top of the ‘timeless wall’...."

Тейза whispered that, и Кирито silently nodded.

Timeless wall. It was a large white marble wall that divided all the territory of Центория in the eastern, western, northern и southern parts — и further into the vast four imperial territories. It was built not by piling cut out the stone, but rather The Первосвященник Администратор made it to appear during just one night.

It is said that this wall, which lasts as much as 750 kilometers from the outer wall of Центрального Собора up to the "Mountain Range at the Edge" that encloses the Мира Людей far away, is impossible to destroy, hence the name of "timeless". It was forbidden to climb it or damage it by the Индекс Табу, и although there would be no one who tried to break it, Ронье understood that she just violated the second mentioned prohibition. Even if she was released from the Индекс Табу binding when she became an Рыцарь Целостности trainee, awareness that has been engraved for many years for years has not disappeared without a trace, so when Ронье looked at her feet she understood she instinctively began tiptoeing.

The marble that was assembled without any gaps in one millis, which should have been exposed to the weather for several hundred years, shined smoothly just as it was newly polished. Behind them, the corner of the wall nearby was sharp like a blade, preventing anyone from climbing.

At that time, a light noise was heard. Two light-blue birds flew down on the top of the wall from the sky. They jumped a little over the marble и watched Ронье with black eyes.

"...... Hu-hu, the Индекс Табу truly has no effect on small birds."

With these words, Асуна gently touched their shoulders, и Ронье smiled at once looking at Тейза. She enjoyed the view once more и then understood it.

"Oh, is it that... Сенпай is going to move on this wall until reaching the Inn in Southern Центория’s 4th district?"

As she asked, Кирито turned around и finally laughed.

"Correct. As you walk here, they will not be able to see you from down there, и if you choose a good location, you will not be noticed by unexpected people when you get off."

"It’s not the first time, is it?"

With the slight delay after Асуна's pressing, he cleared his throat и said with an excusing expression.

"Ah, well, you see, the validation of the escape route is fundamental to the strategy...... Come on, let's hurry."

And Кирито began energetically walking ahead, followed by girls along with contritely looking Асуна.

There was an informal nickname given to each of the four of timeless walls dividing the Мира Людей into four parts.

The northeast wall separating the Норлангарт North Empire и the Eastabarieth East Empire was the "Spring Wall". The southeast wall separating the East Empire и Southacroith South Empire was the "Summer Wall". The southwest wall separating the Southern Empire и the Wesdarath West Empire was the "Autumn Wall". и the northwest wall separating the Empire и the North Empire was the "Winter Wall".

It seemed that even the oldest knights Фанатио и Дюсольберт did not know the reason why the four walls were called with names of seasons. Until the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей was proclaimed, the timeless wall was an absolutely inviolable border, the Центория citizens from the east, west, north и south did not have freedom of exchange in principle, и it was not possible to pass through the gate in each wall with the exception for merchants or wealthy tourists given passes of exchange.

Although the passage requirements of the gates have been eased considerably by that time, complete free passage had yet to be allowed. That was because the aftermath of the Rebellion of Four Empires was not quite completed. There was a possibility that the remnants of the Konoe Knight Order who raised the weapons at the Axiom Church might be hiding somewhere in the Мира Людей и still obey the order of the Император. They may also be involved in killing the old Yazen и kidnapping Lisetta.

While thinking this way, Ронье walked on the "Autumn Wall".

Since the wall had a width of 4 mel, there was no worry that one may stumble unless approaching the edge, и nobody could see the figures of the four from the ground. Perhaps it was the cold wind that blew Ронье's thoughts away, so she just walked ahead absent-mindedly observing the scenery.

On the left side of the wall there was a South Центория mainly made of reddish sandstone, и to the right was West Центория built with blackish slate. The two towns separated by a single wall differed not only in color but also in the design of the build-up. Spacious Southern Центория's houses built from cut square red sandstone blocks produced a liberating opening feeling, while built from thinly sliced precisely и carefully matched pieces of slate building of West Центория with their roofs covered with neatly arranged tiles shaped alike to dragon scales, stood without much clearance, but the effort invested in those houses welcomed the awe of craftsmanship.

Кирито said that in addition to the appearance of buildings the four Центория cities have completely different tastes of food. Ронье и Тейза were free to enter any of the four cities should they wish, but somehow when they got bored и decided to go out to the city they usually went to their native Northern Центория.

*But Рыцарь Целостностиs expected to guard the peace all over four empires could not do even such a thing*, Ронье again felt the need to talk to Тейза walking along, but Кирито leading them stopped ahead before she could.

"Now, this is the fourth district... somewhere here should be the inn......."

As he muttered this he looked around the streets of South Центория. Ронье also turned around и watched the red-brown cityscape.

*Inn, inn.......* after viewing the city for a while repeating that in her mind, Ронье understood she has never been to the inn that was the scene of the incident. Four days ago, when a message arrived at Собора, the mountain гоблин Орои who was already considered the criminal was imprisoned in the Guards office, so Кирито went straight there.

"...... Um, Сенпай, did you come here without knowing the location of the inn?"

Ронье whispered that, и Кирито nodded to her turning his face to the right.

"Err, um, well. You see, there should be a signboard ‘**INN**’ by the inn, but it’s not that easy to notice looking from the top..."

"Look Сенпай, these buildings are so big like mountains, it’s unlikely they will have a signboard conveniently visible!"

To Тейза's fair remark, Кирито nodded "right......" turning to the left. Асуна sighed watching it и took out a folded piece of paper from her cloak.

It was of course not a paper wrapping but a large map, which she quickly opened.

Moreover, it was much finer than ones sold at town's bookstores. It seemed that every building, not just a road, is being drawn there one by one.

"Wow...... such a thing, where from?"

Асуна replied to Кирито’s question without changing the facial expression.

"During my study Я little by little copied the map book that Sones-сан found by chance during the arrangement of the large library. She said that the original map book was not hand-drawn, it was made by a previous librarian using an unknown technique."

"............ Oh, the one of previous generation......."

Кирито murmured и a look appeared on his face as if he remembered something, but immediately he rushed it away и put his face close to the map that Асуна unwrapped.

"Let’s see, this is the 4th district... this one is that street? So, what is it that the inn is here...?"

He raised his head и looked at the eastern side of the wall again.

"Oh, probably it's on the north side of that junction. **Thank you**, Асуна."

To his gratitude in Sacred Language, she answered "You are welcome" in Мира Людей language. After that Вице-Премьер-Мечник folded the map back into the cloak.

They have clarified the location of the destination, but there was still a problem. From the wall 50 mel high they were standing on, they had to go down to the ground without being noticed by residents. If the same aerial elements technique as before when they ascended would be used, it will definitely be spotted by someone.

Looking at Кирито, they were wondering *what on Earth are you planning to do?* Премьер-Мечник casually approached the edge of the wall и glanced down.

"Okay, now there is no one there. Я jump first, then everyone else jumps when Я give a signal."

"Eeeeeee!?"

As Тейза exclaimed in a strange voice, Кирито thrusted out his right hand with thumb up и casually stepped away from the wall. The brown outsole of his cloak disappeared in a moment, и only the dry wind passed by the three people remaining at the top.

Even after waiting a few seconds there was no sound similar to collision so Ронье with Асуна и Тейза approached the edge of the wall и looked straight down. There was Кирито light-heartedly waving at them from the road 50 mel below.

"Good grief......."

Асуна murmured that и straightened both hands towards Ронье и Тейза.

"...... He definitely used flying sacred art."

Тейза squeezed lips и took Асуна’s hand with the same determination as Ронье did a bit ago, so Ронье followed и grabbed Асуна's left hand. Surprisingly delicate, the silky smooth slightly warm hand clenched Ронье's right hand tightly, и the next moment Асуна kicked off the marble wall as easy as Кирито did.

Their bodies were gently raised — for a moment, и them three people immediately began to fall straight down. The wind groaned violently in their ears. The wish to cry out loudly was overflowing, but somebody might notice that, so she clenched teeth и kept silent.

No matter if one is an учениками Рыцарей Целостности, they won’t be alive after falling from a height of 50 mel to a hard cobblestone. *Я believe in you, Сенпай!* In her mind Ронье cried without saying a sound aloud.

Кирито standing near the falling point lifted both hands into a bowl-like shape.

The feeling of something soft и transparent wrapped around their bodies. The falling speed gradually slowed down, the sound of wind weakened. Кирито accepted the three people with an "arm of mind".

Even the senior Рыцарь Целостностиs are limited to as much as moving a single dagger with this technique, it must be a terrible power of mind to allow to slow down the falling of three at the same time. When the ground approached just under ten centimeters, Кирито opened his hands и three people landed steadily. After letting out several nervous и long breathes, Ронье asked their leader.

"....... Um, Сенпай, if you can do such thing, wouldn’t it be simpler to use just incarnation instead of aerial elements when we climbed the wall…?"

"Well, getting down и climbing jump straight up has different difficulty level of the **imagi**... of the concentration of consciousness. Even when it’s just one person Я need to transform clothes into wings when flying with incarnation......"

Тейза stopped by Кирито who shrugged his shoulders.

"Кирито-сенпай, next time Я want to take off myself, please teach me the aerial element flight technique next time!"

"Eee?! T-that is not as easy as it seems...... b-but it's a nice thing to have a curiosity... Well then, let's hurry to the scene."

Асуна pulled the back of collar of Кирито, who began to walk to the North after saying some unnaturally sounding words.

"It is the opposite direction, Кирито-kun."

***

As they turned to the left to the wide road from a dark side road bordered by the Timeless Wall, they found that it was somewhat crowded. It was February, so one could think it would not be unnatural to wear long cloak, but the citizens of South Центория walking along the road were unexpectedly light-dressed. The temperature should not drastically differ from the North Центория because it was less than kilolu away, but the sunshine pouring from the skies to sandstone was somewhat warmer than when they were in the Собора.

Fortunately, four people crossed the South Центория 4th district without running into the guards и arrived to the inn in question.

The three-floor building was quite large but as they only accepted tourists from the Тёмной Территории the accommodation fee stated on the entrance signboard was not even relatively high. Кирито, who removed the cloak hood, glanced at the red sandstone inn и opened the door without hesitation. Overlapping with the sonant sound of a bell,

"Welcome!"

— the cheerful voice echoed.

In front of the spacious hall there was a wide reception desk, и behind it stood the one whom the voice belonged to, a girl receptionist who seemed a little older than Ронье. She wrapped her reddish hair with a dark-green scarf и wore an apron dress of the same color.

As Кирито approached the reception, the woman asked with a smile:

"Are you staying? Four people?"

"Er......."

After a short hesitation, he approvingly nodded.

"Yup, four people. Is it okay if we stay for just one night?"

"Of course, Я do not mind. Would you like to share the same room?"

"Yup, same room. If you can, we would like to take one on the second floor."

Ронье who thought that he would clearly identify himself и ask for cooperation with the investigation, repeatedly blinked watching Кирито talking to the receptionist. As soon as the room was decided, Кирито paid a total of six hundred sheers lodging fee, и the four of them were guided to the second floor.

The room that was prepared for them was in the southeastern corner, и plenty of Solus light was coming through the large window. There was a large round table with fruits in the front, и four beds that are neatly lined up by the wall.

As soon as the receptionist who finished the short tour deeply bowed и left, Тейза cheerfully exclaimed:

"It’s the first time Я stay in an inn other than of the North Empire! The feeling of the room, the shape of the furniture, everything is quite different compared to the north!"

"Hey Тейза, you did not come here as a tourist!"

After hurriedly shutting up her best friend, she turned to Кирито.

"...... Um, Сенпай, what are you planning to do from now on? This room is not the crime scene, is it...?"

"Yup, it’s the different one. But there are ways to find out which room it was. So far, let's have some rest."

This Кирито’s answer largely summarized the situation. Асуна, who took off her cloak и swung a long hair, said:

"Я am going to make tea, you join?"

— и headed to the cupboard in the corner of the room, Ронье chased after her with "Я will help you."

According to the explanation given by the receptionist, when one wanted hot water, they were to bring a pot to the dining room at the first floor<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, but Асуна just poured some cold water from the jug into the pot и produced a thermal element with a smooth incantation.

It was the basic technique of Sacred Art to heat water, but there still was a catch. When the generated thermal element is simply dropped into water, it reacts immediately with the water surface, creating a lot of steam, but the temperature of the water does not rise much. It is necessary to convey all the heat of the thermal element to water, which requires a bit of fiddling.

Sacred Art practitioners carried a valuable medium called the "fire sponge stone" produced exclusively in the Southern Empire и put it in water so that it gradually gave the power of heat element. Simply lifting the container и holding the thermal element under it will boil the water too, but it will take time. As they were watched what is Вице-Премьер-Мечник doing with a show-me-what-you-have-there anticipation, Асуна continued with producing of two metal elements.

It was a nice way to make steel ball with metal element as a substitute for a fire sponge stone, but unlike fire sponge stones which could absorb thermal energy instantaneously, metal ball would not get hot so easily. And, of course, the metal ball does not float in the air like pure elements, so one needs something to support it during heating.

It would be sufficient to have someone nearby using tongs or spoon for that, but it was said that it is not nice to use tools other than sacred art medium in such cases. Sacred Art practitioners believed that everything from generation to completion must be completed by the incantation only. There is a fancy way loved by clerics for its impressiveness, to create a tiny whirlwind with aerial element, и mix the thermal element into the air flow while letting the metal ball to float on top, but such three-attributes technique is difficult to control preserving the ball on top of the whirlwind, so if one’s concentration is disrupted even a bit, one will soon find sparks scattering all around the room.

As Ронье, who quickly got ready to generate ice element to neutralize potential flame, carefully watched over what she was doing, Асуна manipulated the two metal elements with the left hand и kept them close to the thermal element she controlled with the right hand. In this state, two kinds of elements reacted и the hot metal drops were ready to scatter...... и that very moment:

"**Form element, hollow sphere shape**."

Асуна chanted an expression Ронье did not know, и the two steel elements fused together into a sphere of about 3 centimeters in diameter. As soon as it became a metal ball, it gained weight, и pulled by gravity it dropped into a pot.

"Oh, that...... Асуна-сама, where did the thermal element go...?"

Ронье hurriedly looked around but could not find the thermal element that was supposed to be floating in the air. Then Асуна glanced at Ронье's arms и pointed in the pot.

When she looked in, the metal sphere glowed red beneath the water. Small bubbles floated one after another around it, и eventually steam started to rise from the surface of the water.

"Maybe the heat element is in that ball...?"

"Yes, Я confined the heat element within the metal sphere."

"...... such an art......."

While Ронье was getting surprised, water in the pot bubbled, и it was heated to the boiling state.

Normally, to make a hollow sphere with metal element, first they make a ball filled with contents using a "**sphere shape**" phrase и then inflate it with an "**enlarge**" while heating it at the same time. But this too is difficult to control и it tears easily, и even if it goes well you cannot put anything inside.

However, if you can make a hollow sphere from the very beginning, you can confine the thermal element in it by overlapping it at the moment of creation. It is safer than heating an iron ball with a whirlwind of thermal и aerial elements и it is efficient.

"It was ‘**Ho...**’... ‘**Hollow**’? Did Асуна-сама discover such an expression......?"

To this admiration и question, Вице-Премьер-Мечник gently shook her head.

"No, Алиса-сан was good at the creation of hollow spheres, she said that she only told Ayuha-сан that, и Я was taught by Ayuha-сан."

"Алиса-сама............"

Ронье lost her words.

At the time of Войны с Внешним Миром Ронье got an opportunity to exchange words with Алиса Синтез Thirty several times. The most impressive thing was that night in the tent with unconscious Кирито when they were exchanging memorable stories with Асуна и Мира Людей Defense Army general Selrut,0 but Алиса's terrible large-scale light attack that had annihilated the great army of Тёмной Территории in a blink of an eye at the defense battle by the Великих Восточных Врат was also burnt in her memory.

Ронье и others low-grade clerics tried to guess what kind of technique would produce such a power. Of course, it is not where the knowledge of an apprentice knight reaches, but it can still be imagined that it would require to accumulate a huge number of light elements in some way и release them at the same time later. If that secret technique is based on a hollow sphere, it is no wonder Алиса conveyed it to Ayuha alone.

"... So, is it really for good that Я heard it...?"

Асуна nodded with a smile to this fearful question.

"Yes, when Ayuha-сан taught me she asked me... not to misuse it. So Ронье-сан, when the time comes, convey this phrase to those whom you trust."

"............ Yes...... Yes."

Ронье nodded while feeling hot gathering deep in the chest, и then.

Кирито who had been looking into the process from behind unexpectedly said in a relaxed tone.

"It’s still pretty slow...... about making hot water. Maybe if you cast 2-3 ‘fire arrows’ into the basin....... "

"Ah no, Сенпай, if you do that, it will get pure white in the room because of steam!"

It was Тейза who suddenly replied, и Асуна и Ронье laughed together aloud.

As they were enjoying some rest with cups of red tea (brewed with hot water boiled with Sacred Art) that looked like a special product of South Empire, the bell outside the window rang the 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

The melody was the same as in Northern Центория — the Тёмной Территории one was the same as well since we talk of it — but the tone was slightly lighter и felt brighter. Before the echoing of the long trailing note disappeared, Кирито quickly got up и moved to the door.

"Okay, this inn is a break from 2 PM to 2:30 for employees, и they all gather in the waiting room on the first floor. Guests will also be on sightseeing и shopping, и now there should not be anyone in the hallway."

"... Hey, how do you know that?"

Having answered using sacred word "Я heard it at **check-in**" to Асуна's question, Кирито approached the door. He opened it a little и checked the corridor, then nodded immediately и beckoned for Ронье и others to come. She felt uneasy to say the least as it wasn’t clear what to do, but had to follow after him, secretly hoping that they won’t have to do any absurd things inside the inn.

Кирито who came out in the corridor headed north away from stairs without any hesitation. As he checked the doors on the right one by one, eventually they saw a parchment which had inscription 『Out of service』 pinned to the fourth door. Just above that, there was a dully glowing metal plate engraved with the number 『211』.

"Here"

Асуна nodded to Кирито’s muttering. There was no doubt that this room is the crime scene of the old cleaner Yazen’s murder.

Премьер-Мечник reached for a brass grip, but for some reason stopped moving. He brought the hand in front of his eyes и carefully peered at his fingertips.

"... What are you doing, Сенпай?"

To Ронье’s quiet question, Кирито merely muttered something like "No, nothing......" not saying anything clear. However, as soon as Асуна said "It's safe, no way could they reproduce unique fingerprints", he finally nodded и moved his hand to the handle again.

He twisted it to the left и right, but of course, it was locked и stopped halfway. Without thinking what to do next, Кирито silently stared at the keyhole ──

A few seconds later, the sound of an open lock sounded.

"Wow... Сенпай, you can do even that with incarnation?"

To that Тейза’s voice reverbing with the mix of shock и admiration, Кирито answered, shrugging:

"The key и keyhole in this world is not a mechanical device, it’s part of a system, ehm...... of the whole thing."

Тейза made an unhappy face to that ambiguous reply, but the situation did not allow for more elaborate discussion. When Кирито twisted the handle again, it turned to the end this time и the door moved a little. He quickly looked around, peered in и encouraged others to get in.

The room girls stepped in behind Асуна was a very common room for two people. There was only one window on the eastern wall, there were beds on the left и right, и a table, somewhat smaller than the one at which the four of them drank tea just now.

At first sight, there was no difference in appearance compared to their room. Perhaps, there were no fruits on the table и the curtains were closed. However, Ронье felt that this was the scene of a horrible murder.

Кирито who came in the last gently closed the door. Асуна stopped near the table и turned around, silently nodding.

"... Is it really safe, Асуна?"

— Кирито said with a worried tone. Ронье as well as Тейза shared the same feeling.

Sacred Art department head Ayuha Furia mentioned that the load of the past reflection art discovered yesterday was too big. In Мира Людей she was one of the best practitioner, и if she says so, it might not be easy to use even for Вице-Премьер-Мечник Асуна having the God power.

But Асуна nodded again with her usual gentle smile.

"Yup, it’s OK. For Oroi-сан who has to endure the limitations because of this... и much more for Yazen-сан murdered, we must catch the criminal as soon as possible."

Having said so in a clear unwavering tone, she took a piece of folded white hemp paper from the leather bag hanging by the Меч belt of her simple knight clothes. A glimpse over the unfolded sheet would reveal that it’s densely covered with many lines of sacred characters.

"............ Got it. Relying on you."

Кирито said the short phrase in a voice that made one feel the convincing confidence и signaled to Ронье и the other one to stand back to the wall.

Асуна left alone in the center of the room silently read the sacred words from the paper for over several tens of seconds, then folded it carefully again и put into a leather bag. Apparently, she had memorized the words of sacred art beforehand и that was simply the last review.

Sacred Art certainly has a clear difference in success rate, accuracy, и power when reading a technique written on a paper compared to casting a completely memorized art. Кирито mentioned the reason is because Sacred Art is also intertwined with the power of incarnation. Therefore, the memorization of the art wording is the basic for the practitioner, but the past reflection art Асуна started to chant was much longer than Ронье's expectation.

She could understand that first a crystal element was generated и formed into a thin disc but the continuation of the incantation was something she heard for the first time, so she could not understand it’s meaning. Regardless of this, the affluent intonation Асуна chanted the incantation with was fascinating. и then…

Suddenly the room got dark.

"............!!!"

— Тейза pulled the air in grasping the hem of Ронье's cloak. As ethereal darkness crawled around the floor, their legs became cold.

The sound of Асуна's voice, which began to bear the trace of rumbling и reverberation, broke for a moment.

Suddenly her upper body shook. Кирито moved his right foot half a step forward but stayed on the spot. Casting resumed, the darkness started to grow deeper.

Suddenly the crystal disc lying on the table floated up in the air without any sound. Elegant purple light flowed from it illuminating Асуна’s face from below.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p109.jpg)

Looking at her painful expression, Ронье also shrieked her lips. *Я would like to help Асуна, but this technique is only for masters. Besides, she is challenging the gods’ work itself peeking at the past events. The secret the Первосвященник Администратор built, securely sealed in the deeps of the Elders Council ──*

Асуна, whose whole body was now constantly trembling, moved her hands to the disk. She rapidly moved thin fingers, и the overflowing purple light followed, flickering irregularly.

Suddenly a distorted voice, as if heard from under the ground.

『…… ou…… rent…… a serf Yaze…… rial do……』

Male voice ── but only that could be understood. Then sounded another male voice, a doubtful one.

『Ah, err…… not…… myself…… a active tenant…… perial……』

『……erfs of my…… belong to my ter…… end to dislike that, then right here……』

The voice of the first man, with unexpectedly increased clarity, said ruthlessly:

『…… enjoy the death……!』

A thud sounded, overlapped with the scream of the second man.

Immediately afterwards, the crystal disk turned into a myriad of fragments и crumbled. The arms of Кирито, who jumped like a wind to catch Асуна falling down to the floor, firmly supported her body.

***

Four people quickly left the room 211 where the darkness faded и hurriedly flew back to the first room.

Кирито laid Асуна, who was using his shoulders to move around, to one of the beds.

"It, it's all right now."

Кирито gently pressed down Асуна’s shoulders while she was trying to rise quickly saying so и turned his face to Ронье.

"Excuse me, will you bring us a glass of water?"

"Y-yes, just a second."

She ran over to the cupboard и poured some cold water that remained in the jug into the glass и brought it back. Кирито who took the glass slightly raised Асуна's body, bringing the glass closer to her mouth.

AS she slowly drank three gulps of water, Вице-Премьер-Мечник smiled at Ронье with a somewhat alive face.

"Thank you, Ронье-сан."

"It’s nothing……"

Was the answer as she looked down. *I’m useless for anything except such tasks, but at least Я can say that there are cases where Я can help the two of them in some way.*

Since Асуна’s exhausted state was not due to decrease of the Life, it could not be recovered by Sacred Art. Кирито who should have been aware of it, but Премьер-Мечник returned the glass to Ронье и holding his hands in the air silently generated three light elements. Those softly floated around lying Асуна, gently illuminating the beautiful face with closed eyes и glossy chestnut hair.

The light elements broke off from Кирито’s control и disappeared by scattering small light drops in less than one minute, but Асуна lifted the eyelids as if she gained some vitality from that shining.

"...Yes, I'm fine now."

"Do not push yourself, you'd better take some rest."

As Кирито quickly said this, Асуна completely raised her upper body.

"No, we have to hurry......."

Кирито tightened his profile to these words, и Ронье also gazed at Тейза.

"...... What did you see? Have you understood how the murderer killed Yazen by avoiding the Индекс Табу?"

As a question to jump in, Асуна made a long blinking as if to verify his memory и gave a slightly hoarse voice.

"In the glass disk, the first thing that Я saw...... a man who cleaning the room moments ago. Я think that it was Yazen-сан. Then the second man, standing by the other side of the screen, said to Yazen-сан: 『Thou, is not a serf Yazen of the Император’s domain?』...... like this."

"Император’s...... domain."

As Кирито repeated this quietly, Асуна nodded as well.

"Yup...... Yazen-сан nodded at first, but then immediately denied it: 『No, I’m not. Myself is no longer an active tenant of the impreial domain』...... Then the second person said with a sort of...... sneering tone: 『Serfs of my territory belong to my territory until they run out of life, so if you tend to dislike that, then right here enjoy the death granted』and stabbed Yazen-сан's chest with a dagger....... Yazen-сан fell down on the spot и the man left the room holding the dagger. That was what Я saw there..."

Асуна went silent, but no one tried speaking for a while.

Since no high-level cleric can tamper with the past events, it was confirmed that it was not Орои who killed the old Yazen. It was a cheering evidence, but it undeniably the mystery has increased again.

Кирито, who was standing one knee beside the bed, raised his body и looked at the door of the room.

"....... The man who killed Yazen-сан dropped the blooded dagger in the corridor, knocked nearby room и disappeared. The mountain гоблин Орои who was sleeping in the room noticed the dagger lying on the corridor, picked it up и was captured by South Центория guards who came to check the place. That is what happened after Yazen-сан's murder. "

Кирито’s explanation was enough to Ронье, but Тейза next to her said "But ..." uncertainly.

"Кирито-сенпай, weren’t guards too quick to come to a murder location? The criminal who killed Yazen-сан knocked Oroi-сан's room и ran away, и it seems that only few minutes have passed before Oroi-сан picked up a dagger......."

And it has be told, she was right. Кирито also nodded looking gloomily.

"That's right. It was supposed to have been that guards rushed here because a citizen reported to 4th district Guards office that there was a sub-human with a knife acting dangerously at the inn. But in fact, Орои just picked up a fallen dagger, there was no dangerous behavior in his actions. In other words, it was either the murderer themselves or their partner reporting... ── Асуна, did you not see the murderer at all?"

When asked, Асуна nodded, regretting.

"Yup... Я felt like Я was always in front of the image floating on the glass plate... or rather......"

She slightly opened her mouth и blinked as if searching for words, but quickly sighed.

"... Sorry, Я cannot say it better."

"No, you do not have to apologize."

Said Кирито, coming close to Асуна и gently hugging her.

"Even though Я could not see the criminal directly, Я could hear the voice, и Я understood many other things. For example, ...... the culprit who killed Yazen-сан did not utilize a complicated **trick**...... did not avoided the Индекс Табу somehow, it just seems that he normally stabbed his heart..."

This was also true, come to think of it.

Асуна took risk и used Past Reflection art to find out both "how" и "why" the criminal killed the old Yazen. Still the motif remains unclear, but the method has been discovered. There was no trick used but rather just a stab with a dagger. In other words, ............

"The culprit is not bound by the Индекс Табу......."

Кирито confirmed Ронье’s muttering with a heavy voice:

"That's what it is....... Я do not know yet the reason for that though..."

"Я do."

Асуна interrupted, и the three turned their gazes to bed.

Вице-Премьер-Мечник appearing almost recovered said while looking at the faces of three people with her tea-with-milk-colored eyes.

"...... Я think, the words of the criminal who killed Yazen... Я think that's why he could kill him."

"Words ...... 『Serfs of my territory belong to my territory』...?"

"Yes...... The reason why the culprit could ignore the Индекс Табу was because Yazen-сан belonged to the aristocrat’s private territory и was a subject to the decision right of the one..."

"……Indeed!"

Кирито sharply inhaled и looked outside the window as if hoping to see the criminal standing there.

"It may not only be the old Yazen but as well any other former peasant released from private territories could be killed in the same way.... That's why Асуна said 『We need to hurry』"

"Yup…… If we don’t hit his hands before the next victim comes, that’s what Я thought... but......."

It was clear to Ронье why Асуна bitten her lip. Moving the discussion ahead, she cautiously said:

"There are nearly 1000 former private territories peasants in the North Empire alone, quadrupling in Мира Людей as a whole...... It is impossible to protect or give an escort to all of them."

Тейза stepped ahead on a side и said, flinging her hands.

"Besides, not all the people who have been released remain in Центория. Я heard that more than half have left the central capital и chose to have their own farmland where there is a free space. Even just searching for them, perhaps could take weeks..."

"In Мира Людей...... Я do not believe there is a family register."

Next to Кирито who speculated using unfamiliar words, Асуна also kept frowning for a while, but soon lifted her face.

"...But, if the purpose of the criminal is to spark the war once again between Мира Людей и Тёмной Территории, they should not just blindly kill the former private territory tenants. That sin, it would be meaningless unless the responsibility is laid upon tourists from Тёмной Территории."

"Well then...... who we should protect are the Тёмной Территории people...?"

Кирито who heard the words of Тейза nodded deeply.

"Yes...... Я actually thought of coming to this inn either today or tomorrow. To invite Oroi’s fellows who are waiting here to come и visit the Собора. Oroi's **homesick**...... hometown missing illness, Я think, should be aided for a while with that......."

"But Сенпай, there are lots of tourists from Тёмной Территории......."

When Ронье said so, Кирито gently shrugged his shoulders.

"Surely. Fortunately, their numbers и accommodations are recorded properly, so the search is easier than for the former private peasants. As expected, it is impossible for all of them to stay in the Собора, so Я think that we need to plan to schedule their return a little earlier beginning today so that they return home in order. If you construct a carriage formation with an escort getting them to the Великих Восточных Врат, the criminal cannot mess around it."

"If that’s decided, let's move right away."

Кирито tried to quickly support Асуна who got up from the bed, but it seemed unnecessary. Even so, Вице-Премьер-Мечник smiled with quiet "thank you" but quickly returned to a resolute expression.

"So... do you know the room where the mountain гоблинов are staying?"

"Of course. It is a room for four on the first floor, so it's probably just below here. The one that should have the guards in front of the door... half for the escort и half for the watch...."

"It cannot be helped, but if we move them to the Собора, that need is gone. Let's go."

Ронье и others chased Асуна who began walking quickly.

***

However.

The four people who went down to the first floor saw an unattended corridor и a vacant cleaned room. The receptionist, questioned by Кирито, told them with a puzzled expression, that in the morning an official of the South Центория administration brought a carriage и told them he takes three mountain гоблинов away.

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>.Я just understood Я never called that out previously. For European readers: the floor numbering is — mostly — visually 1:1 in Japan, where “the 1st floor” is the first one available, not “the 1st one to live”. So, in this example, using British/Irish standards, that would be: they are located at the first floor и the dining room — as expected — is at the ground floor.
