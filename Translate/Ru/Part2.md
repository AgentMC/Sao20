# Part 2

"Ah...... that reaction was so wrong............"

Ронье, Тейза и Асуна smiled at the same time, looking at the Премьер-Мечник who held his head with both hands и sighed deeply.

When the long meeting had finally finished, Ронье who returned little Berchie to Фанатио tried to head to the big dining room at the tenth floor to have lunch but was stopped by Асуна on the verge of rushing down the stairs. *How about lunch together?* Certainly, there was no reason to refuse if invited, и the two people immediately accepted it, so Веце-Премьер-Мечник took them to the Центрального Собора’s Ninety-fifth floor, the "Наблюдательный пост Утренней Звезды".

There were only pillars on the four sides of wind-blown platform, while most of the floor was a beautiful flower garden with a clean waterway, и at that time the floor was effectively the Собора’s top. The stairway rising to the ninety-sixth floor was sealed with an indestructible door created by Асуна with her divine power, и not only Рыцарь Целостностиs but also Премьер-Мечник Кирито could not pass through.

A white table was set in a corner of the garden, и Кирито who appeared three minutes later than the three people groaned in a miserable voice sitting on the chair. "That reaction" was, of course, the scream he let out as soon as he heard the name of Selka Zuberg.

Ронье и Тейза also exclaimed the moment the Frenica’s name was read aloud, but since they were friends with her at the first year at Академии Искусства Меча, it was not unnatural for two of them to be surprised.

But in the case of Кирито, the situation was somewhat... or rather, it was quite complicated.

Ронье и her friend have heard story of how Кирито и Юдзио left the village Rulid of the Northern borderlands и survived a number of trials in the neighborhood to finally become Академии Искусства Меча's students, but that story was not disclosed in Собора.

Because the reason Кирито with his partner aimed at Центория was to retrieve the golden Рыцарь Целостности Алиса Синтез Thirty, who was born in Rulid village и has already become a legend, from Axiom Church.

In the present situation where many knights still believe the Highest Priest's tale that the Рыцарь Целостности is an ambassador of gods summoned from the gods’ world, the information relating to "the Рыцарь Целостности’s birthplace" must be kept in secret. In addition, it was Дюсольберт Синтез Seven who during his many years of service, that included the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей, took young Алиса from Rulid when she violated the Taboo Index, и he didn’t have memory of such event anymore. Дюсольберт himself seemed to recognize the truth of "Синтез ritual" to some extent, but considering young knights, he wouldn’t deliberately develop the topic.

Although Кирито explained that the reason why he was surprised with Selka Zuberg's name in the morning meeting was "Because it resembled a person who helped me way back", it wasn’t quite convincing и Фанатио и others did not appear to buy it immediately.

Асуна smiled и said in a comforting voice to Кирито who was keeping his head atop of the desk.

"Well, there's nothing you can do to it, Кирито-kun. When Selka-сан reaches the Центрального Собора, everyone will understand that you know her."

"Oh yeah, but.... Я wanted to prepare as much as possible before everyone starts questioning..."

"If you talk preparations, it probably worth having arranged that both you и Selka-сан give identical impression, right? That’s what Я was thinking about......."

"Ugh, makes sense......."

After Кирито nodded without trying to raise his face, Тейза expressed a slight hesitation:

"Um...... Кирито-сенпай."

"What is it, Тейза?"

Премьер-Мечник finally raised his head и looked at Тейза. и then her redhead best friend, after some more hesitation, said such a thing that surprised even Ронье.

"Я think that it would be better to not to hide the truth anymore...... To explain Рыцарь Целостностиs that they were born in Мира Людей just like everyone else was."

"Wa-wait a sec, Тейза......."

Ронье hurriedly tried to block her best friend's words. "Синтез ritual" of current Рыцарь Целостностиs was the biggest secret of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей, и that’s why she did not think that it was a good thing for an apprentice knight to say.

But Кирито waved his hand to stop Ронье, then smiled и looked at Тейза again.

"Yeah, Я also basically agree. Summoned from the gods’ world...... there are too many reasons for that fairy tale to come out as senseless. Among the old knights, Фанатио-сан и Дюсольберт-сан, perhaps Шейта-сан all have noticed the truth to a considerable extent already, и one day...... no, as soon as possible, Я think Я have to explain the real thing to all Рыцарь Целостностиs.………… However……"

Having said that, Кирито hesitated for a moment having a look like he is worrying for Ронье и the other one.

"...... Sorry, Я am about to recollect the bad things... but both of you remember, right? The last moments of Raios Antinous'..."

As soon as they heard that name, Ронье и Тейза sitting side by side both froze on the spot.

Two of them could never forget it. Raios Antinous was an elite Мечник-in-training when they were valets of Кирито и Юдзио. He treated his valet Frenica terribly, и when Ронье и Тейза protested about that case, he almost raped them, covering with the “aristocratic judgment” privilege given to the nobility.

Кирито и Юдзио jumped into the room in a critical moment и saved the two of them, but Raios who lost both arms slashed by Кирито's blow, died in a strange way that still gave them shivers when the scene was remembered.

He did not lose the whole Life by massive bleeding. Rather, he let out a bizarre scream that cannot be thought of as a human’s one, then he collapsed on the floor as if the very soul of him had disappeared... и died. In the subsequent Войны с Внешним Миром, Ронье и the other one witnessed many times people и sub-people losing their lives, but never have seen such a death.

When the two of them began to tremble badly, both Кирито и Асуна sitting across the table simultaneously leaned ahead, pulled the hands of Ронье и Тейза to the middle of the table и wrapped them firmly with their own hands. The hands of two humans who came to this world from the Real World were warmer than anyone else’s, и the cold wrapping Ронье quickly disappeared.

*Thank you very much*, she did not say these words but simply nodded, the two across nodded with a similar smile и returned to their seats. After breathing deeply, Ронье asked again.

"....... Is there a relationship between the last moments of elite Мечник-in-training Antinous и the Синтез Ritual...?"

Кирито instantly shook his head.

"No, there is no direct relationship. But...... people who live in Underworld are can become like Raios when one's mind is subjected to extreme loads."

"Eh……"

Ронье и Тейза opened both eyes wide, but Кирито waved quickly again.

"You do not need to be afraid, you two are all right because that phenomenon only happens to those who are bound by a very rigid ideology."

"Rigid...... ideology?"

"Yeah, at that time, Raios put his Life on the scales against Taboo Index. For Raios who seemed to be made of self-esteem, his life should be given priority above everything else. But at the same time the Taboo Index is the absolute law that should not be violated no matter what happens. To violate the Taboo Index or to comply with the Taboo Index и die... neither of them could be chosen, и the Raios’ soul has collapsed."

When Кирито became silent, Асуна who would have already heard that story also had a look of mixed fear и resentment. Кирито kept on talking after lightly touching the hands of Асуна laying on the table.

"Besides, there is a story Я heard from Фанатио, that in the defense battle by the Great Eastern Gate even the giants’ former chief lost his mind и then screamed the same way like Raios. The giants tend to stabilize themselves by believing that they are the strongest among all the races... Я think that stereotype was about to be destroyed и he had gone mad. The problem... perhaps, for some Рыцарь Целостностиs, believing that they were summoned from gods’ world may be the foundation of their soul of equal importance."

For Ронье who witnessed the strength и the nobility of Рыцарь Целостностиs every day, Кирито's fearful words gave totally perplexed feeling.

Of course, the fact that everything about "Синтез ritual" is lies — the fact that the Highest Priest Administrator had deceived all Рыцарь Целостностиs, would mean terrible shock to them.

But knights, fearless, depending on nobody but themselves, they can endure even that. Not like Raios Antinous, they won’t let their soul collapse.

Or was this just a wish? Even after becoming a knight apprentice, Ронье continued embracing heartfelt respect и admiration for Рыцарь Целостностиs even when it came to talking about Incarnation и teaching Меч skills и Sacred Art on a daily basis. She wanted them to be an absolute existence that cannot be hurt by anything ─ this way she felt, but was this really the truth...?

Ронье, deeply depressed, heard a trembling voice of Асуна.

"Hey, Кирито-kun. Я wondered for a moment... Taboo Index is absolute for people of Мира Людей, is it not? So that just as one tries to break it, their soul would collapse."

"Ah... not really. Usually, the ‘Seal of the right eye’ will be activated before the soul collapses, и they will not be able to continue thinking of violation.... The reason why the seal did not activate for Raios was that he never tried to commit an offense but acted from an absolute confidence, Я think because of that he fell into a **loop** of choosing between two taboos, that he must protect both Taboo Index и his life."

"Senpai, what is ‘**loop**’?"

It was Тейза who interrupted. Кирито answered with a sort of embarrassed expression.

"Even though I've planned to be careful, somehow **Eng**... a sacred word came out. Loop is ring, or something of that shape, it included the meaning of "never-ending" or "repeating"...... Good explanation?"

Кирито gazed at Асуна who smiled и nodded.

"Я think it was pretty good, the remaining meanings would be "to tie up" or "to wind around"<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>.

"Uhu, uhu, thank you very much!"

Having thanked him, Тейза took out of a compartment of her uniform ─ there was a sacred word for it, seemingly "pocket" ─ a small square book of white hemp paper bundled with yarn threads и a copper pen. She quickly turned over sheets of paper already filled with small letters и arrived at a blank sheet, where she wrote the meaning of "loop".

"Wai... wait, Тейза, what's that?"

"He-he, Я got paper scraps at the management department и made it. If Я write it down this way, Я will not forget the sacred words that you have taught us."

"Se… secretly, such a thing..."

Ронье panicked a little to the surprising acumen и effort of Тейза who was supposed to hate studying even more than herself. She poked the flank of her best friend и whispered.

"Please tell me how to make one later."

"Hu-hu-hu, you know Я occasionally want to eat a honey pie from the ‘Jumping Deer’ pavilion."

"Я understand, surely..."

Кирито watching the exchange between the two of them leaned against the backrest и said:

"Well, Я hope the system will allow us to increase the production of white hemp. Я want three harvests now… or even five ones."

"Even tenfold would not be even closely enough."

Suddenly added Асуна.

"Ideally, everyone in Мира Людей...... no, in all Underworld should be able to use notebooks и copper pens freely."

"That would be great if that happened..."

Said Тейза who seemed to have unexpectedly recognized the pleasure of studying, staring at her small book.

"Since parchment is so expensive, children of lower classes like me и Ронье wrote in water-soluble lotus leaves ink, then washed it away и reused over и over. The regular paper made by hitting White-thread grass is cheap, but in just one week it’s life is exhausted и it will crumble.... Я think that any child will love to learn if this white paper becomes available for free."

"Well, afterwards Я hope to make as many textbooks as possible..."

Ронье also nodded deeply this time to Асуна's words.

For a while Кирито was flying around the Мира Людей to find the material for the paper which would combine the durability of parchment paper и the accessibility of regular paper. Finally, he found snow-white hemp, a pure white plant growing only on the rocky mountain in the northwestern part of the Northern Empire. Cutting its leaves и stems finely и stewing in a large pan, и when ready, pouring the thin layer of a goo over a flat surface, и before it’s Life begins to decrease, drying with thermal и aerial elements to change its current state from low-durability “plate” to high-durability “cloth”, и then rolling a large rolling pin many times over it to finish и smooth it — this way one can make white paper.

It was much cheaper than parchment only sixty cen of which can be made from a single sheep и its durability is high enough to compete with parchment, but it took more effort than regular paper, which is made by knitting White-thread grass vertically и horizontally и then hitting it with a mallet, и the material, snow-white hemp, was not available around the central capital. At that time, a field of snow-white hemp has been opened in the rocky production area, four manufactures were also completed in Центория, и sales of white hemp paper for the residents of the central capital has been started, but it still was higher priced than the regular paper. Even new to that all Ронье understood how hard it was to make this a cheap produce for children of Тёмной Территории as well as Мира Людей.

However, for Кирито и Асуна the mass production of white hemp was not the final goal. It seemed that they wanted to make a massive number of textbooks in which Мира Людей languages, mathematics, и methods of learning techniques would be described.

"...... If textbooks get distributed to one person each, children can study at any time..."

It was Тейза who took over Ронье's words.

"Even for the textbook of the elementary Sacred Art, they say, it takes skillful craftsman a month to copy a single book. Of course, it is very expensive...... My father bought a textbook because Sacred Art was an entrance exam subject of Академии Искусства Меча, still it was only possible to buy an early copy where characters had lost their shapes, which seemed to be a terrible regret. It is still my treasure."

Actually, Ронье shared the same experience.

The highest-class books at Мира Людей, textbooks carefully copied with the same "axiom typeface" as used in the Taboo Index, were priced at more than 1 million shears, и lower-ranking aristocrats could not buy it, not to mention ordinary people. So-called "quick-copy" textbooks, appearing if a young craftsman copied it with some misshaped letters, would fall in price much, but it was still elite shopping.

"This is something to take care of. Then, someday..."

Кирито said that while smiling, then he paused и heavily sighed.

"...... Mass production of textbooks will be many times harder than white hemp paper, but well, we’ll take care of it patiently, because there is plenty of time..."

"...That's right."

Асуна nodded with a somewhat mischievous smile.

"So, Кирито-kun, it was not only the Меч skill but also the Sacred art test, when you took the entrance exams of Академии Искусства Меча."

"Ah, that, Я was among the top twelve...... Я wish Я could say. But Я learned Sacred Art from Юдзио fervently supervising that Я learn only stuff Я should."

When hearing that, Тейза smiled и chuckled. However, her laughter seemed to include emotions other than joy, и Ронье could only slightly open her mouth, without saying a word.

Асуна who has a consoling smiling smile, looked at the blue sky visible between the columns и an expression of vexation blinked across her face.

"Anyway, both of you are probably hungry. Let’s have lunch, can you help me to carry it?"

Of course, Кирито also got upright immediately as Ронье и Тейза who stood up at the same time. From the time she was his valet, Ронье always said "Let me do it" at such times, but even at that time Кирито would not sit down и wait for service. *SenpAI really did not change*... as she was thinking so walking behind Асуна, Тейза took out the pen и the notebook again и said:

"So, Асуна-сама, ‘notebook’ is some sort of book for records?"

**Grrr** — it was Ронье who could not help clenching her fists.

***

On the first floor beneath the "Наблюдательный пост Утренней Звезды", on the ninety-fourth floor of the Собора, there was a kitchen, not as wide as the large kitchen on the tenth floor, but convenient и a well-equipped one.

As soon as Асуна opened the double door, the sweet scent of honey и the fragrant aroma of burned cheese stroke her, и the Ронье’s stomach shrunk tightly.

The kitchen was built with marble floor и white ceiling, there were many tall cupboards on the walls on three sides, brightening its appearance with the variety of tightly packed ingredients и colorful vases и bottles. On the remaining wall there was a shelf with cooking utensils и a large furnace; a large white wooden workbench was placed in the center of the wide room.

As four people entered the kitchen, a slender figure behind the workbench lifted the head.

It was a young woman wearing a white cook’s coat with no stain on it и a cylindrical hat above the short hair. To be exact, she should be referred to as 'very young'.

The woman who was sitting on a chair и grinding a large kitchen knife stood up looking at Ронье и others. Briefly bowed to Асуна, she said:

"Асуна-сама, Я left it wrapped in the oven to keep it warm. Salad и bread will be there as well."

"Thank you, Hana, Я am sorry to be late."

Асуна, after saying the apology, walked up to a large hot oven set on the wall at the back of the kitchen. This cooking utensil, which burns the fire under the tightly sealed box made of stone и bricks и heats the contents equally, was called "**tenpi**" in Мира Людей language, to distinguish it from "**tenpi**" meaning the light of Solus, it was more common to call it an **oven** in the Common Sacred Language.<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>

Of course, both **salad** и **bread** were common sacred words too, so this time Тейза did not took the notebook out.

Асуна, who opened the door of the oven after fitting thick leather gloves, pulled out a large container with lid from inside. The container seemed to emit the smell of cheese.

Speaking of what enclosed the cooking, it was a simple shallow pot used to cook various ingredients in a flour dough baked around them, but it was unheard that someone will be cooking by putting such a pot in the oven. In the first place the oven was used for baking bread. With the look of excitement, Асуна moved the elliptical container to the workbench, и carefully removed the lid.

"Wow, wha… what is... this ...?"

It was Тейза who said this loudly. Ронье also bent her neck.

And then it appeared from the container, the edge burnt a little, white и thin, like a piece of paper....

"Hu-hu, this is a ‘paper wrapped bake’."

As Асуна proudly declared this, Ронье и Тейза opened their eyes wide with "Eeeh…".

"What, paper, real paper? White hemp paper......?"

Веце-Премьер-Мечник nodded with a smile to this mistrustful question.

"Я got some paper that was burned during the drying process from the paper plants of Собора и tried it."

"But, if you bake it in the oven, the paper will burn quickly, will it not?"

"It would burn if it is ordinary paper. Я have not tried parchment, it’s too precious to be used in cooking. But white hemp paper, which as expected gained high durability, has properly fulfilled its duty."

As she said so, Асуна pulled the folded white hemp paper with her fingertips. It made a dry rustling sound but did not collapse. Despite being exposed to the high temperature of the heated oven, paper seemed to keep the Life intact.

While removing the leather gloves, Асуна continued:

"The cuisine of Мира Людей...... of Underworld is simple, but it is ruled by strict laws. Whether you bake it or simmer, ‘food’ does not become ‘dish’ unless it is heated for a certain time or more. If there is not enough heating it gains the **status**...... it becomes ‘half-baked’ or ‘rare’ и the stomach will hurt if you eat it, и on the contrary if you heat too much, it becomes ‘burned’ и it will be hard и bitter."

"Y-yes......."

That was the first thing any girl learns has from her mother when she is taught cooking. *Rather than half-baked or burned, proper fire should be turned* ─ they listened to Асуна's words automatically remembering the saying from the past.

"The only problem is that the dish becomes the most delicious at the moment when it changes from ‘heating’ to ‘cooked’, right? It the heating continues, the more it goes on, the more it moisture gets lost, the dish gets harder, и the taste of ingredients dissolves out of stewed dishes as well. In the case of stewing, there is also a way to saturate the taste of the soup by continuing heating with a low heat while adding ingredients, but it takes too much time и trouble."

"Y-yes......."

As Ронье nodded again, the unique taste of the mysterious ‘Obsidia boil’ she ate in the capital city of Obsidia was about to revive in her mouth, so move quickly said:

"...... but, how is this related to paper used in cooking?"

"Well, at first, Я tried to figure out the moment when the ingredients burned up, but Hana stopped me..."

When Асуна shifted her gaze, a white hat woman said without changing her expression:

"It is a trap that beginners и experts both fall every now и then. It wasn’t possible even for skilled chefs to figure out the perfect moment in hundreds of years. A long time ago, a person with an outstanding skill of determining, a chef called a genius of a kind being born once in one hundred years was invited to the Imperial Palace и cooked for the Император Norlangarth. Both the appetizer и the soup were masterpieces but the main dish, a big red-horned cow steak was taken from the fire only a moment earlier than needed. The Император who ate it got stomachache и exercised aristocratic judgement privilege to cut off the cook’s arms."

While Ронье и Тейза stood speechless, Асуна shook away a shadow of sadness и said.

"... So, Я decided to give up looking for the moment of baking и let it pass through as it is. But, instead Я asked Hana if there is a way to retain the moisture even if one cooks it over time, и she told me that if you put it in a bowl with a lid и bake it in the oven, it will be somewhat different."

"Heeeh...... Я also learned a variety of dishes, but Я have never thought of such a recipe. You are truly an exclusive chef of the Highest Priest."

As Тейза showed her admiration, a woman named Hana shrugged her shoulders.

"It is in the past already. ── Anyway, you need hardware with high priority that cannot be broken even if heated in an oven, и even in this Собора oven baking is not perfect... instead of getting out freely, the water accumulates in the bowl и the dish gets half-braised и the taste of ingredients is diluted."

"So, at first, Я tried traditional wrap, Я wrapped the ingredients in dough, then put it in the bowl и baked it. But after all, the taste и moisture were gone out of the ingredient...... It was still OK if you eat it with the baked dough, but after all, the taste of the ingredient alone was bad. So, to preserve the moisture of the wrapped food from being lost, Я was considering whether there is something that can resist heat, и eventually Я came up with this white paper."

"Heeeh....... So, that’s what you mean by a ‘paper wrapped bake’?"

Ронье muttered that while staring at the contents of the vessel.

"So, is it now that you are going to unwrap it...?"

It was Премьер-Мечник who had been silent till now who said that with a faint miserable voice. Apparently, he endured the hunger but the limit seems to have come.

Асуна giggled и picked the slightly scorched edge of paper with slender fingers.

"Actually, today is the first time to try. So if it fails you can only have salad и bread for lunch, sorry for that."

"E-eeeh?!"

That exclamation came not only from Кирито but also Тейза. Of course, Ронье felt the same as well. While watching Асуна's hand, she prayed to the goddess of earth Terraria who also controlled the food.

The paper unfolded from all sides one by one, и as soon as it was opened on the left и right, Ронье felt an incredibly saturated mellow aroma spreading all around.

The main ingredients were white fish fillets, mushrooms, vegetables и plenty of herbs, with cheese melting on top. It is understood at first sight that the heating was proper, but unlike baking in a pot, it did not burn or shrink at all. It seemed that most of the moisture was preserved.

"Looks good, is it not?"

Асуна also nodded to Hana's voice.

"Well, let's enjoy it while it's hot. Кирито-kun, please help me to get five plates."

***

In the end, five people including Hana persuaded by Асуна had lunch consisting of white paper wrapped fish, bread и salad at the table at the 95th floor.

After recollecting his experience of the past era, Кирито also helped with his serving skills и the dining table was set-up in only a few minutes. Five people raised cups with warm shiral water<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>, и at the same time picked up knives и forks.

The fish placed on the dish was still steaming up stimulating a lot of appetite, yet Ронье carefully sniffed the scent for the second time. However, vegetables, mushrooms, и molten cheese fragrance became completely unaffected by a burning white pages smell, which was not present at all.

The fish emanated a fresh fillet elasticity, but it was easily cut through just by touching it with the knife. When brought to a mouth, it amazed with the gentleness of the product. There was plenty of juice, it was hard to believe that heating has been taken to the finish.

"Wow...... It's quite different from direct flame-grilling! It's sooo tasty!"

Ронье agreed with Тейза's impression, so she also nodded. Асуна tasted carefully и looked like she was satisfied и nodded, but immediately tilted her neck a little.

"Yes, Я managed not to miss a lot of moisture as planned... but after all, there is almost no fragrance of direct fire left......"

"How about removing the lid of the bowl и the white hemp paper close to the finish, и then roast it a little with thermal elements?"

As Hana suggested so, Асуна turned her face to her.

"All right, it's going to be fairly fragrant by just burning the surface a little. Next time, let's stop heating 20 seconds earlier и try it."

While the two cooks were exchanging opinions, Кирито remained silent ── he was completely absorbed by the dish и kept moving the fork. Ронье worried that he would not say anything till the very end, и involuntary whispered to the right Кирито.

"Ehm, senpai, what impression of taste do you......"

"……Hmm?"

That time Премьер-Мечник was stuffing his mouth with fish, vegetables и mushrooms, so after munching for some time, he pushed out a word:

"~pasthy!"

Асуна helplessly shook her head:

"Except for that, Я do not really expect Кирито-kun to share a comment of a gastronomic critic level...... but something tells me you can be a little more specific."

"Well… th-then... Я want to eat even the wrapping paper!"

Three people who knew him well sighed at the same time, Hana tried to keep abstract и expressionless, but Ронье did not miss that she winced.

Happy lunch ended in about 30 minutes, и Hana cleaned up dishes, a task she had toughly insisted on leaving to her, и four people who remained on the ninety-fifth-floor shared feeling of satisfaction staying silent for a while.

Кирито и Асуна, real-world humans, made countless big и small changes to Underworld. The biggest one would definitely be an aristocratic system reform, but for Ронье it was much more about the changes that she could experience directly in everyday life, such as the development of white hemp paper и its application in paper wrapped baking.

The two of them were at that time trying to improve the healthcare system in smaller towns и villages, as hospitals existed only in big towns. Currently, in the remote villages и similar settlements, treatment of injuries и diseases is carried out by **sisters** и **brothers** alone, и there were many cases where treatment could not happen in time, such as when a large number of injured people appear simultaneously. In addition, advanced luminous element-based treatment techniques were considerably more difficulty in comparison to dark element art и similar ones, и in some cases less experienced clerics could not cope with life-threatening injury or even major injuries.

The number of Мира Людей people who lose their lives in accidents or epidemies would be drastically reduced if they succeed in building hospitals with full-time clerics specializing in treatment techniques in all towns и villages. In addition, Кирито together with her wanted to develop folk remedies comprising drugs, bandages, poultices, etc. instead of relying solely on Sacred Art for advanced treatment.

Ронье thought it was wonderful for the world to progress into a better state by the advancements that the two of them can bring. At the same time, however, she felt something like a faint anxiety.

Мира Людей had hardly changed within the three hundred years under the rule of the Highest Priest Administrator — in particular the establishment of a governing system dividing in the four empires. It is because the Highest Priest wanted the "permanent stagnation" state for the world, as a result Мира Людей neither did solve the problem of great aristocracy as well as the gap between the central capital и the frontier, nor had the world got worse any more.

Кирито и Асуна, on contrary, continued to make constant efforts to further develop both Мира Людей и the whole Underworld. Even taking this one thing, that the general people who were oppressed by the great aristocrats due to the private ownership of the territory were released, the world has definitely improved.

But as the world changed, the expectations people impose upon the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей... or rather directly upon its representatives Кирито и Асуна will infinitely expand. From the perspective of an apprentice knight such as Ронье, the two of them have power equal to gods, but still they were never omniscient. Ронье felt uneasy because she knew how much Кирито regrets и grieves that he could not save Юдзио. *In the future, if the crisis that could not be avoided even with the power и knowledge of Кирито и Асуна — an ultimate catastrophe transcending the Войны с Внешним Миром strikes the Underworld, what kind of words will surely be thrown to Кирито и her, it becomes inevitably terrifying....*

“Ehm… Асуна-сама?”

The voice of Тейза sounding next to her pulled Ронье's consciousness back from anxious thoughts. Асуна who was drinking tea boiled after meals blinked и asked:

"What is it, is Тейза-сан?"

"Come to think of it, Я guess Я interfered in what you were saying before the meals? Certainly, it was about the Taboo Index?"

"Was it so……"

At the same time as Асуна tilted her head, Ронье rewound her memory.

Indeed, it seemed that Асуна had asked Кирито something about Taboo Index after the talk of whether to reveal the truth of "Синтез ritual" to the upper Рыцарь Целостностиs и others. Afterwards, Кирито talked about the mental loop of choosing between two taboos that Raios Antinous caught, и Тейза asked something about the meaning of the sacred word loop, from which the topic diverted to the increase of production of white papers и Тейза’s notebook. Which means ──.

".... hey Тейза, Асуна-сама's topic was changed in the middle, it's not your fault!"

When Ронье shouted that loudly, Тейза who seemed to have reached the same conclusion slightly put out her tongue.

"Well, maybe it was."

"Altogether... Асуна-сама, really sorry."

When she lowered her head on behalf of her best friend, Веце-Премьер-Мечник chuckled и swung a hand gently.

"No worries, Я would have said something should if Я was concerned of it. Well... и what Я wanted to ask...?"

With a smile, Асуна turned her eyes to the left.

"......Uh, Кирито-kun, for the people of Мира Людей the Taboo Index is absolute, trying to break it would trigger a ‘seal on the right eye’ or in the worst case the mind would collapse... is that the understanding?"

Кирито, once again questioned, nodded while adding some milk, that was just obtained this morning at the stables of the Собора, to his kohiru tea:

"Yeah, Я think that's the case in principle."

"So then... The criminal who killed Yazen-сан, a cleaner at the inn in Southern Центория, either broke the seal of the right eye, or avoided contraindication in some way, or he was not bound by the Taboo Index from the very beginning?"

"... Yeah, Я think it's one of the three....... About the third one...... if that is correct, the criminal will be a Тёмной Территории person rather than a Мира Людей person, but even in that case, it is still necessary to break the ‘Law of the Strongest’ of Тёмной Территории as much absolute as the Taboo Index. Isukan, the strongest person within present Тёмной Территории, has issued a documental order to prohibiting of doing bad things in Мира Людей..."

Ронье who heard these words timidly lifted the right hand after recollecting some of Асуна's earlier words.

"Ehm, senpai, may I.......?"

"Go ahead, Ронье."

"It is in the past now... but the man in the black robe who kidnapped Isukan-сама’s и Шейта-сама’s baby at Obsidia Castle was obviously ignoring the law of power, was he not? Because he took Lisa-chan as a hostage и ordered Isukan-сама to kill my senpai......."

Upon hearing that, Асуна, who should have received detailed reports, и Тейза, who learned details directly from Ронье<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup>, hardened their expressions. However, Кирито himself only vaguely nodded и answered.

"That is so. In other words, that kidnapper believes that he is stronger than Isukan, or he obeys orders from someone who is…  or he believes they are."

"That's what Я mean, there’s something...... slightly wrong with this story. First of all, how do people of Тёмной Территории confirm that the one to follow is stronger than oneself? No doubt, there must be ways other than a fight."

"Isukan's fist fighters clan should do it. Whether it's a battle or a game....... But surely, not all the residents are fighting with each other. Briefly, there is a mechanism in which the strongest one among races, guilds, и clans is chosen to be the leader. Prior to the war, the leaders composed a governing body called ‘Ten Lords Conference’ to decide on various laws. Today, the name has been changed to ‘Five Clans Conference’, but the actual mechanism remained the same... Isukan is among the leaders who are participating in the Five Clans Conference, the strongest ones in individual areas of power."

"... Then, even if that kidnapper thinks he is stronger than Isukan-сама, that alone cannot break the Law of the Strongest, can it? Unless he fights Isukan-сама to prove it."

As Ронье said so, Кирито sighed folding arms on his chest.

"Well... it depends on the strength of the thought....... At the time of the "Rebellion of Four Empires", the four Императорs rebelled against the Axiom Church by breaking the first Article of Taboo Index which they should have been bound by. The belief that the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей overtook the Axiom Church justified the right to regain the Church from us for the Highest Priest to the degree when it exceeded the control of the Taboo Index. If there is something that generates a thought as strong, it may be possible to break the Law of the Strongest without fighting directly with Isukan."

To that words, Ронье’s back lightly trembled, as she recalled Император Крюгер Norlangarth VI’s self-esteem almost physically seeping into the space surrounding him. Next to her, Тейза also pulled her neck in before speaking in a quiet voice.

"...... Certainly, the Император seemed to never consider the Union Council at all. But that was because the Император has dominated the empire for hundreds of years...... is it possible for a human without such a background to rebel against his superiors only by his beliefs?"

The answer to Тейза came from Асуна, whom she interrupted already for the second time.

"Sure, that's true, Taboo Index or the Law of Power — one needs a good **backbone** to break through with beliefs и self-justifications. Oh, the **backbone** means the spine, support, the spiritual kernel."

"Y-yes."

"So...... that is what Я myself wanted to ask Кирито-kun about."

When Асуна turned her gaze to him, Кирито blinked bluntly.

"Huh……?"

"Regardless of whether the one who killed Yazen-сан was from Мира Людей or Тёмной Территории, either someone who ordered the killer or the murderer himself would have the same strong и distorted spirit as Императорs of the four empires once had. What Я wondered, however, was that if you have such a human being, it could have been even worse in Мира Людей...... Я mean, they could have caused the same catastrophic incident as Lisetta-chan's kidnapping in Тёмной Территории. Of course, Я do not neglect Yazen-сан's life...... but what Я am trying to say, if the criminal aims at the discord between Мира Людей и Тёмной Территории, there are more suitable **targets**... ones to aim at."

"In other words, they have a social position...... For example, aristocracy, large merchants, their families...... That's right..."

Looking at the face of muttering Кирито, Ронье said:

"W-wait, but if Yazen-сан's case is to make Кирито-сенпай to go to **Тёмной Территории**<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup>...... would it not be sufficient to aim just anyone?"

"Umm... well, no. If Я were a culprit, Я guess Я would make a case causing more **impact**. I’d try to increase the probability that Я will have to reach Obsidia..."

As Кирито said “Umm” submerging in his thoughts, Тейза asked Асуна for the meaning of "**impact**". Must be her notebook was getting substantial update that day.

*By the way, location names such as "Obsidia" и "Центория" are probably also derived from some sacred word, something corresponding to them......* Ронье thought.

Асуна, who sipped kohiru with tea with a bit of sugar, said in a flat tone.

"Hey Кирито-kun, Я think Я will try it."

"Eh... you will try what?"

Кирито asked that with a somewhat worried face.

Асуна's answer surprised a lot not just Ронье и Тейза but even such an unreasonable и reckless person as Премьер-Мечник himself.

"Ayuha-сан's past reflection technique. If you really can see past events и you use it in an inn where the incident happened, you should be able to see the culprit."

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>Keep in mind, we’re not talking English word meaning here, but rather katakana ループ.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Welcome to the Japanese class. So, the native name for an oven would be 天火 which is pronounced “tenpi”. The “sunlight” would be 天日 which is also pronounced “tenpi”. But in Japanese it’s common to use “imported” word “oven”: オーブン, “o-bun”, which is used here и below. As for the next passage, it’s also 2 words of a similar kind.)
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>Sorry, couldn’t find an English canon: is it "siral", "chiral" or "shiral" Katakana lessons Я took say "shiral", but hey maybe your canon differs?
4. <a name="Prim4"></a>Original reads: “who heard the story directly from Ронье”, but that’s not true as Тейза only has heard about the kidnapping an hour ago or so, и we’ve been following them almost without interruptions since then.
5. <a name="Prim5"></a>Not sure if it matters, Ронье says the name here in Sacred Language.
