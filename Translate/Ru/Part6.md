# Part 6

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

The Северной wind that was getting warmer day by day gently stroke the blue lake. The light of Solus reflecting on the surface of water burst into a bunch of small sparkles jumping across ripples.

The lake Norkia in the Северной Центория suburb was located in an area full of low hills, и although the ice has just melted half a month ago, young early plants already sprouted on the shore и small yellow flowers colorized the view.

This area was the richest ground in the suburbs of the capital area, where everyone could enjoy beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons, but for many years ─ more than 100 years actually, it has not been possible for general people or lower aristocrats to come here. Because Lake Norkia has always been part of the "Император’s domain", the largest one among aristocrats’ private territories.

All the private areas were released after Rebellion of Four Империиs, и now anyone could enjoy coming here freely, but due to the fact that spring was still somewhat away, there were no figures around the wide lake other than Ронье, и Тейза, и two young dragons.

Мира Людей Calendar year 382, February 24th.

After completing the morning practice, Ронье и the other one took permission from instructor Дюсольберт и knights leader Фанатио, и even from Премьер-Мечник for Цукигаке и Шимосаки to leave Собора. Кирито was sorry that he could not go with them — but Ронье was fine with that, since the two of them did not just come to play. They were going to practice the advice they got from the stable keeper Хайнаг yesterday.

When Solus reached zenith, two young dragons that were running around the grassland и playing, came in front of Ронье и Тейза sitting on the rocks of the lakeshore и began to yap one after another. Probably running so much finally made them hungry.

The small horse-driven carriage they used for the movement so far ─ despite the coach was inexperienced, Тейза hired him to get them out ─ contained two lunches of dried meat и dried fruit just in case, but Ронье said without delaying any further:

"Цукигаке, Шимосаки, today you two are going to catch the lunch for yourselves."

"Кю-ру......?"

It is unclear how much the dragons understand human words, but when they saw the pair tilting their heads having a confused look, Тейза smiled и rose from the rock.

"Here, come on!"

Тейза walked on to the waterside stepping on short grass, Цукигаке и Шимосаки followed her shaking their tails. Behind them, Ронье also got up и walked silencing the footsteps.

Тейза stopped at the shore where whitish rocks were exposed и carefully looked into the water, murmuring:

"Is there any..."

Ронье’s eyes caught countless shadows that swam quickly next to each other in transparent water. A number of small fish that overwintered under ice were forming schools. She crouched down и whispered to the dragons sticking their necks out between the two of them:

"Here, Цукигаке, it's fish. и it’s surely delicious."

The young dragon which recently left fish uneaten looked up at Ронье’s face и said "Kururu......." in a suspicious voice. Holding down the back of the dragon which began to back with the right hand she added some more words:

"Today, if you do not catch fish, there will be no lunch."

"Kuru~......"

That wasn’t true, и furthermore since she terribly wanted to laugh hearing the miserable voice of the dragon, but had to push, she frowned making a merciless face.

Ронье и Цукигаке kept staring at each other for some time until ──

"Кю-ру-ру!!!"

Шимосаки who cried loudly swung small wings a couple of times to inspire himself, then quickly jumped over the water. He folded the wings in the air, straightened the long neck, и dived into the lake head in front.

Small fish swimming near the bottom of about seventy centimeters depth scattered in all directions. Following one of them, Шимосаки showed some brilliant swimming skills, wriggling the whole body.

A dragon is a creature specializing in flying in the sky as its name suggests<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, и the "Dragon nest" by the frontier of the Западной Империи is a steep alpine surrounded by a vast lake tens of times larger than Lake Norkia, so apparently wild dragons swim in the lake freely и catch fish. Цукигаке и Шимосаки, born in the Собора, have only bathed in shallow ponds in the front yard, but instinctively seem to know how to swim.

After a few tens of seconds, Шимосаки broke through the water surface, jumping out и landing to the original shore while vigorously flapping its tiny wings. Тейза и Ронье had no time to avoid it shaking the whole body и sprinkling a lot of water drops from wet feathers all around.

"Wow."

In spite of his turning the face away from the water drops, Ронье noticed something glittering in Шимосаки's mouth и tried to look closer. It was a trout of a silver body with small red spots visible over it. It appeared small when it was swimming underwater, but when looking closer it seemed to be a twenty cen full-length.

Цукигаке approached и moved his nose to the caught trout being kept in Шимосаки's mouth и carefully smelled it. But shortly afterwards Шимосаки turned his head upwards и swallowed the fish.

"Кю-ру-ру-ру!!!"

To a satisfied cry of a young dragon, Тейза added in a somewhat astonished voice:

"The one who gets it, the one eats it."

But Шимосаки waved his tail again as if to say that he was still hungry и jumped into the water again. Цукигаке also looked into the surface of the lake but stopped its movement.

"Hey Цукигаке, do your best."

When Ронье encouraged it, after moving the body back и forth numerous times hesitating between hunger и diffidence, finally crying:

"Kuru~~!"

in a loud voice, Цукигаке also jumped into the water.

*Я can chase the light-yellow figure with my eyes; although her movements feel slightly awkward compared to Шимосаки just now, she swims hard to chase fish. But the swarm of trout quickly moved from side to side и could not be easily caught. To Цукигаке which is of a quieter personality than Шимосаки, Я guess, the burden of sudden fish hunt was too heavy......* At that time, Шимосаки who overcame them earlier, jumped in front of the school of trout. Цукигаке plunged into the space where the surprised school got disarranged.

As it jumped out of the water surface, a splendid trout, of about 25 cen, was held in the mouth of the young dragon returning to the shore.

"Ку-ру-ру-ру!!!"

Ронье also happily shouted to Цукигаке who boastingly showed the prey giving the loud cooing:

"You did it, congratulations Цукигаке!"

And of course, it is all great to make the young dragon happy, but Ронье unexpectedly sighed. Apparently, it was fun to catch fish, but it seems it didn’t help with the problem of fish disliking.

*If you do not eat it, you’ll have no lunch......* Тейза interrupted her just before she was going to begin scolding.

"Hey Ронье, that, she gives it to you, does she not?"

"Eh……?"

After blinking couple of times, she asked the young dragon:

"...... this fish, is this for me?"

Then Цукигаке cried as if enjoying she finally understood:

"Ку-ру-ру~!"

"All right...... Thank you, Цукигаке."

She stretched the right hand и scratched the head covered with water drops. Lifted the still pounding fish up with her left hand и smiled.

"Я will have this for my lunch, but the next one you can eat yourself."

"Kuru!!!"

And of course, after a loud cooing, Цукигаке again jumped into the water.

From that point on, the progress of the dragons significantly advanced ahead. Instead of chasing independently, one chased a school of trout и the other went on ahead. At the moment when the flock was caught between the two of them и got disoriented, they simultaneously caught prey.

By the time the flock ran away to a deep place, Цукигаке и Шимосаки caught five trouts together, ate three of them и gave two of them to Ронье и her friend. The trout simply roasted by the bonfire burnt of some dry branches had pretty much artless flavor compared to handmade paper wrapping cooking of Вице-Премьер-Мечник they enjoyed the other day, but they felt it was as tasty, either because the product itself was fresh or because Цукигаке и the other one got it.

***

Just as the stable keeper said, Цукигаке’s fish dislike has been corrected in a blink of an eye и it became same way not picky like Шимосаки, which ran around the grass once again playing after finishing the meal. The gardens of Собора were also large enough, but the dragons were also comfortable in the nature.

Ронье deeply inhaled fragrant air, thinking that they will go out more now.

On the little hill not far away, a chestnut horse, tied to a standing tree, was carelessly grassing. There was a flock of about ten white water birds by the lakeshore, и butterflies fluttered from flower to flower. As usual, there were no human figures besides the two apprentice knights.

"It’s a shame, these territories were released, Я wish people from the central capital come и play here..."

When Ронье murmured that, Тейза, who was drinking tea from a bottle next to her, slipped a chuckle:

"Ронье seems to be used too much to Собора life. Today is not the Seventh day<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, so you cannot go out of town that early today."

"Ah... th-that's right."

*Certainly, children are still studying at school, adults are supposed to be at work or doing housework. Although we’re just apprentices, we still can execute the privilege of knights who can act quite freely except for training in the morning, but Я do not think that it is common around other people....* having pondered this way, Тейза added a little abruptly:

"Oh, but, as Я heard, this Император's domain is empty even on the Seventh day, while other private areas seem to be visited quite a lot."

"Hmm............"

Ронье raised the gaze when she heard it.

The Норлангарт Северной Империи spreads out in a shape of a fan from the central capital Центория. In other words, the nearer to the capital city, the narrower the land is; from the area about 10 kilolu away from the Северной gate of Центория they were in, the timeless wall separating the land between the Западной и the Восточной was still clearly visible.

*Император's domain monopolized the land on the Западной side of the high road running straight Северной from Центория, и the territories of nobility were lined up on the Восточной side of the road. In other words, because the location of this territory is relatively close, there was no reason for onlookers to ignore it.*

Glancing at the profile of Тейза, she noticed that the area around her nostrils was twitching a little. It was a sign of her enduring of saying something. Having a slightly bad feeling, Ронье returned the question that her best friend was expecting:

"............ Why is the imperial territory so unpopular?"

Then Тейза coughed a little и pointed to the other side of Lake Norkia.

"There, can you see the house over there?"

"....... Yup."

Small nod.

On the other side of the lake there was a small forest, with a sharp pointed black roof protruding from the middle. A building of a castle size rather than a mansion was a villa which Императорs of Норлангарт dynasty used for generations as a lodging when visiting the territory outside of the imperial capital. Before the Rebellion of Four Империиs, they said, that nearly 20 guards и servants were stationed there, but at this time it was completely blocked, the entire site was surrounded by a chain bearing ‘Keep Out’ signs with no exception for anyone.

"The Император's house? What's wrong with it?"

Тейза got a stranger look и said, looking to the one sitting next to her:

"....... Because of what’s there, in that place..."

"Of what’s there...being what?"

"It seems, they say...."

Whispering in a low voice, she brought her face closer to the right ear of Ронье ──

"It’s haunted!"

".................."

*I’ve got no clue what to respond to this.* She kept silent for a few seconds и asked briefly:

"By whom?"

That moment Тейза broke the serious face и shouted:

"Come ooooooon, you’re boring! That’s supposed to be scary!"

"Well, you were preparing for that story all the time from the morning."

"Naturally, Я did not have a chance to scare Ронье before."

After Тейза complained using a sacred word that Кирито told her, Ронье asked again lightly poking her with the elbow:

"That's not Тейза's imagination, is it? Where did you hear such a story?"

"Last Seventh day...... the day you и Кирито-сенпай went to Тёмной Территории, Я shopped in the 6th district market и Я asked an old man from the bakery. He said, recently the number of people going to see the former private aristocrats’ territories on the Seventh day increased so the bento и pastry baking business runs pretty well, but the former imperial territory seems not to be popular, because of the ghost appearing near the mansion......"

"Talking ghosts nowadays..."

Ронье shook head in surprise.

According to the old story told when she was a child, before the Церковь Аксиом was formed, ghosts used to appear in the streets и villages all around и they were doing various things. But they were exterminated by church priests и Рыцари Целостности, и now it has become quite peaceful — all the stories have ended that way. Actually, Ронье has never seen any kind of scary ghosts mentioned in old stories.

"About that, the real battle, where casualties were among the Императорs who did not surrender till the end, the generals originating from the royal family и the great aristocracy, or the heads of the Императорs’ armies — was happening only in the four imperial capitals of Центория, was it not? So why are there ghosts in the villa in the Император’s territory?"

As soon as she heard these quickly voiced arguments, Тейза blinked a couple of times и smiled again:

"Hey, Ронье, aren’t you thinking of some mischief?"

"Mis...... mischief, not at all!"

"Fu~wa. So then...... is it not that we should quickly check it?"

"Eh?"

She winced back hearing this sudden suggestion.

"Ch-check...... that mansion?"

"Of course."

Nodded with a clear face, Тейза continued to stretch her back.

"Look, if such a suspicious rumor is spreading around, it might have an influence on the Union Council’s plan to reuse the former private territories, right? Even though we are still only knight apprentices, since we are the members of the Рыцарь Целостности team, shouldn’t we go for it if we think that investigation is necessary?"

_── But Я don’t think it is_<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>.

That was her first thought frankly speaking, but the advantage of her best friend’s opinion was surfacing clearly. *Instructor Дюсольберт repeats that a knight who just waits for orders becomes useless. The whole afternoon was dedicated to correct Цукигаке's picky behavior ─ which is why we are here at the lake, but the daytime is yet to last for long.*

Ронье sighed и moved her gaze from her best friend's face to the Южной sky.

A small hill blocked the view и the cityscape of Центория could not be seen, but even though it was ten kilolu away, the hulk of Центрального Собора was towering in the blue sky. Over there, Кирито и Асуна should be waiting for investigation reports from the Южной Центория administration now. In the case of its conclusion being a miss, which is likely to happen, a large-scale search will be conducted throughout the city of Центория; should an emergency occur before Ронье и others return, senior knight Ренри is supposed to come to the rescue riding his dragon Kazenui.

"...... Я see."

With as much as possible calm face, Ронье looked at Цукигаке и Шимосаки running cheerfully around the nearby meadow.

"But what about these guys?"

"Don’t you want to take them? Something ghost-like shouldn’t like dragons which are sacred creatures. If it really comes out, though."

After a while, Ронье nodded to Тейза's words about which she wasn’t sure how serious the other one was. It is only Рыцари Целостности who can breach into the mansion sealed by the name of the Церковь Аксиом, и dangerous creatures such as bears и wolves as well as ghosts cannot appear in such a place, so even if they take young dragons, there won’t be any danger.

"So, well......."

"Then, it's decided!"

Having exclaimed so, Тейза vigorously stand up from a rock she used as a chair. Ронье stood up as well и said touching the handle of the Меч of the Moonlight that was hanging at her left hip.

"For such a case, Я wish Тейза would have already picked a new Меч."

Then her best friend glanced down to her own Мира Людей Defense Army standard Меч и shrugged her shoulders.

"Well, that's right, but Я also like this Меч...... hands completely accustomed to it..."

She knew that feeling very well. Ронье was anxious to change a familiar Меч, и it was hard to let it go, so she couldn’t force her.

When she silently nodded, Тейза smiled again и looked at the dragons.

"Шимосаки —, Цукигаке —, come over! We’re going for a walk!"

To which the dragons, apparently full of energy after eating plenty of fish, synchronously answered "Kururu ──!" fluttering small wings.

***

In order to move from the Восточной bank of Lake Norkia to the Западной bank where the sealed mansion stood, they had to make a considerable detour Северной or Южной.

The Южной side of the lake appeared to be wetlands, so the two of them headed Северной. It was easy to walk because parched grassland<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> continued there. However, in order to go around the vast Norkia lake it was necessary to walk three kilometers и they were worried if it is too much for the physical strength of the young dragons, but surely, they were cubs of a creature being able to boast with the greatest value of life in Мира Людей, so both cheerfully walked after two people.

It took them more than ten minutes to reach the Северной end of the lake where there was a small river flowing into Lake Norkia и a solid stone bridge. This river was a branch of the Rul river, which originated in the Северной extremum of the Норлангарт Северной Империи, the Mountain Range at the Edge, и its main stream flew along the high road to the central capital, filling the waterways stretched in the city with clean water.

When they were at the Академии Искусства Меча, Кирито и Юдзио told that the source of the Rul river is located in close proximity to the village of Rulid where they were living. When Тейза pointed out that if they would have made a small boat и sailed down the river they could reach Центория without having any hardships —Кирито и his friend were both silent for a while и then said simultaneously "Я could not think of it".

In reality there were many shallows, torrents и waterfalls on the way и it would not be easy, but Кирито и Юдзио still said that when they’d come back to Rulid someday, they will try it on the way back to the capital. Тейза и Ронье used to dream that should such a time come, they would join the two people, but that adventure was no longer possible.

They jumped down from a slightly shifted grassland to a fine cobblestone road и crossed the bridge.

From there to the mansion there was a single road. After they walked for some time, a vast field came up on the right. Shrubs lined up in order were grapes grown as the source of wine.

Ронье's father, a lower-class aristocrat, once said that if you turn all the vineyards in private territories of the Император и the Great Aristocrats into wheat fields, it would cover all the wheat consumption in the Северной Центория within a year и they won’t have to bother about the bread from the Северной region. The terrible size of the vineyard immediately convinced her that it was not an exaggeration at all.

Moreover, the wine the Император drank was made only from the best grapes from these grape shrubs, so regardless such a vast number of shrubs, vine made on this vineyard did not reach the mouth of the general public because they brew only a small amount.

Hana said that when she was the exclusive cook of the Первосвященник Администратор, the Первосвященник did not care much about the luxury of drinking и eating, so the vine delivered from a liquor store in the central city — of course it must have been top quality as well ─ was fine for her; but, perhaps, Император Норлангарт was secretly proud that he was drinking superior wine than the Первосвященник.

"...... What will happen to this vineyard...?"

Тейза walking next to her muttered this quietly, so Ронье slightly tilted her neck.

"It seems that it is not decided yet even in the territory reuse plan whether to leave vineyards or turn into wheat fields. Some of the former private territory people who have taken care of these plants until now want to go back here и continue making grapes......."

"But, if you have such an area, you cannot maintain it without considerable manpower....... Я heard that similar problems are occurring in the former imperial territories of other Империиs."

"Язен-сан, who was in the territory of Император Южнойacroith, Я wonder which way he wanted..."

Тейза replied after a short time after Ронье doubted.

"...... In the vision that Асуна-сама saw through the Past Reflection art, Язен-сан said that he was『no longer an active tenant of the Император’s domain』, so he did not intend to go back."

"That... that's right. Я wish he could enjoy a new career he had just found......."

They kept silent for a while, walking under soft sunshine.

The wind flowing though the unmanned vineyards shook feathers of the young dragons who were walking a little way ahead. Twisting grapevines stood leafless due to the cold, but yellow-green young leaves will soon bloom vividly throughout every branch. If they keep vineyards, by that time someone has to begin taking care for thousands of grapevines.

"...... You know, Тейза, if there are not enough people to work in the field......."

Ронье muttered this unconsciously but closed her mouth halfway. To Тейза who seemed to be curios, she said "No, nothing", which wasn’t truth.

*In fact, you should migrate гоблин tribes who are forced to live in remote areas of the Тёмной Территории и have them to work in the fields —* that’s what she wanted to continue with.

*But then, we will have the гоблинов replacing the serfs once forced to live a hard life in private territories. Of course, nobody is going to force them to work, but they will have to as the income will be the result of their labor; so, when it comes to "get inside и get to work", Я think it means the гоблинов will be treated almost as slaves.  
── No, Я can’t say that.*

The majority of people living in the Мира Людей was forced to decide on the Sacred Task in the age of just ten years и start to work. It was rather an exception for children to enter high school like Ронье и Тейза did, и even for those two people, if they have not been учениками Рыцарей Целостностиs, they should have had no choice but to either join the Мира Людей Defense Army or to marry someone their parents decide.

*Я could not choose the future on my own, just like private territories serfs, so, in the essence, is there any difference between us?*

The doubt that had never occurred to her before swirled in her head, и Ронье almost froze in her steps. But suddenly, Тейза next to her exclaimed:

"Ah, there, the gate can be seen!"

She blinked и raised the face to see a beautiful black steel-made gate rising in the end of the road, where Тейза pointed to. On the other side of the gate there were magnificent old trees standing in lines, и the road continued into the darkness where the light of Solus did not reach.

After quickly walking the final hundred mels, the two stopped in front of the gate.

In the center of the gate consisting of thin steel bars, there was the huge emblem of the Норлангарт Северной Империи, depicting a lily и a hawk. Beneath, there was a sign attached bearing a white tree, being an emblem of the Церковь Аксиом, и a sentence saying 【No trespassing without permission of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей】 written in black.

In addition, the gates were severely blocked with a sturdy chain, и the chain stretched to the left и right, it seems it surrounded the whole forest which was not small at all. Of course, it was possible to cut the chain or jump over anywhere around the gate, but there was no one in Мира Людей able to try to break the blockade after looking at such a sign.

Following the two people, Цукигаке и Шимосаки looked up at the exquisite chain, snuffed it и snorted at the same time.

Meanwhile, their owners exchanged looks и Тейза said:

"...... We are the members of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей, right?"

"...... Every day we attend those meetings, is it not?"

Ронье replied this way but it should be mentioned that she used to onlook rather than attend the meeting. However, sometimes ─ sometimes she was asked for remarks, so she was not a complete outsider either.

Тейза nodded with gulp, then suddenly made a stern face и put the right fist on her chest и the left hand on the handle of the Меч.

"учениками Рыцарей Целостности, Ронье Arabel! In the name of Объединённого Совета Мира Людей, requesting the passage through this gate!"

The other one for a moment froze in a mute amazement, but somehow replied "Y-Yes" to a knight’s salute returning the same. Тейза took down her hands и said "Now, you too", eliminating the last resort to go back.

Similarly, the young dragons got permissions as well, и they all walked about ten mel to the right of the road и passed under the chain supported by thin iron poles.

As soon as they felt the air getting cold, they shrunk their necks. They would keep thinking that they just entered the shade, but it seemed that some unexplainable heaviness was contained in the air.

After they walked under the mossy trees и returned to the cobblestone road, Ронье confirmed the purpose of this unofficial mission with her partner.

"Hey Тейза, we came here to investigate ghost rumors... is this correct?"

"That's right."

"This means, we can go into the mansion?"

"That's right."

After nodding twice in a row, Тейза gave a mischievous grin:

"Weeeell, could it be that Ронье is afraid of ghosts?"

Of course, she couldn’t admit it there. The memories of the scary stories heard during childhood were likely to be revived, but she denied with a sturdy face:

"There’s no reason for that... besides, there are no ghosts in the present age."

Then Тейза’s grin faded away for a moment, but the expression immediately returned и she tapped Ронье's back.

"If so, Я let you go into the mansion first! Yup, go, go!"

"I...... Я understood..."

While thinking that she was tricked anyway, Ронье started walking with her back being pushed.

Supposedly, it had been more than half a year since this whole forest has been sealed, but the ground under the trees was kept unexpectedly clean. Or it may be that weeds are less likely to grow due to the deprivation of Solus’ и Terraria’s blessings because of the tall old trees. The air that was so refreshing when they were on the hill on the other side of Lake Norkia seemed to be a bit stagnant.

While walking, Ронье turned around to see Цукигаке и Шимосаки, who were well ahead of two of them until the gate, but now were following. The young dragons sniffed the smell of the road with a slightly disgusted faces и shook the raised tails left и right.

"What's wrong, Цукигаке?"

When she said it, the dragon following behind responded with a quiet "Kururu......". It looked like she is quite reluctant to proceed, but she wouldn’t stop.

A dragon is tied with a strong bond to a knight и sometimes tries to defend the owner by sacrificing it’s life. In fact, Ронье saw, just before the end of the Войны с Внешним Миром, in order to protect the knight Ренри from countless spears thrown by real world red knights, his beloved dragon Казенуи received those spears by itself.

As the war had come to an end, situations when Цукигаке or Шимосаки, already grown-ups, must do such a thing will hopefully never come. Still, Ронье was hit by a sense that something tightened in her chest for a moment.

*Today's day out is in the first place because of the dragons, so if they are uneasy, it would be better to stop studying the mansion......* she thought, but Тейза would not stop her feet. Forced to turn back, she lined up next to the partner.

*Come to think of it, the attitude of Тейза is a bit weird, Я feel she is not the usual her. Even when suggesting to investigate the mansion, although it was a joke, she was strangely stubborn, и in the first place it was happening all of a sudden. It's as if she had planned this investigation mission since it was decided to go out to Lake Norkia.......*

"Hey……"

The moment she tried to talk to her best friend, the sound of the 2 o'clock bell far in the Южной in the central capital was heard. Тейза quickly turned the face to her и said:

"It will be dark if we don’t hurry. Let’s run!"

"U…uhu."

Inevitably nodding, Ронье chased after Тейза who began running. Young dragons also fluttered small wings и followed bouncing off the ground. Even a child of a flying dragon can get tired и it’s Life then starts to decrease the weather, so they’ll have to eat dried fruits brought from the carriage by the time the dawn comes.

The forest surrounding the mansion did not seem to be wide from the outside, but the winding road took them some time. About ten minutes passed since they heard the two o'clock bell, и finally Ронье was relieved to see the light ahead.

In the middle of the forest, a circular space of about 100 mel wide was cleared, и the problematic mansion was quietly standing in the middle.

It was built of dark gray stone, и the steep roof was black. It seemed to have 3 floors, but because it has few windows, it looked more like a fortress than a mansion. The front yard had already almost disappeared flower beds, but they only gave cold feelings because only the withered grass was growing there.

"... This is the villa of the Император, for real...?"

When Ронье muttered, Тейза also tilted her head a little.

"Yeah, this...... this being the case, even residence of some great aristocrat would seem bigger....... ah, wait, there."

She lifted the right hand и pointed at the big front door.

"There is a lily и a hawk crest on the door, which should be only used by the Император."

"Yup……"

Because there was an emblem of the Норлангарт family on the iron gate at the entrance to the forest и on the door of the manor, there was no doubt that this was the Император's villa.

"... Let’s go..."

Тейза whispered и started walking. Next, head down, followed Шимосаки.

Ронье looked down at Цукигаке by her feet и asked: "Are you all right? Not tired?", to which the young dragon answered "Of course" or something similar since she spread her wings и gave a short chirp.

They walked the path stretching through the dead grass, between the flower beds, и stopped in front of the large door.

Ронье looked back, but the blue water surface of Lake Norkia obscured by trees could not be seen at all. When a thought that there was no meaning to build a lakeside house in such location came to her, there was a metal sound coming from behind. Тейза was grasping handles of both the left и the right doors with both hands trying to push them down.

"…… does not open?"

In response to Ронье's question, her friend gently rocked the red hair.

"Yeah, it sounds locked."

"Well, that would be expected if you think about it... doesn’t this mean that there is no one in the mansion?"

Ронье said so hoping to convince Тейза, but her friend wouldn’t let go her hand of the handle.

"But if it is a ghost, it can pass through even if it’s locked, can it not?"

"Eeee...?"

— frowning at unexpected objections. Certainly, ghosts of ancient tales usually had no real substance и it looks like there were some which could slip through walls и doors.

"...... even so, we just can’t leave it like this..."

Having muttered this, Тейза closed both eyes still gripping the handle, и gave a strange groan.

"... N... n-mu-mu-mu-mu...."

"W-what are you doing?"

"Mu-mu-mu-mu-mu......!"

"S-stop, Тейза, come on!"

She finally noticed that something was wrong with the way her friend gripped the handle.

*Тейза must be trying to imitate the "Pick of Mind" that Кирито showed us in the inn at Южной Центория yesterday.*

"Hey...... we still cannot use even the "Arm of Mind", и of course we can’t do something like picking a lock!"

Ронье pointed out completely amazed, but Тейза’s profile remained seriously resolute ─ perhaps even desperate rather than that; having noticed that she breathed in some air.

After hesitating a couple of times, she quietly asked:

"....... Тейза, why, so hard...... Is it so important to investigate the ghosts rumors...?"

Then Тейза slowly breathed out и let go of the handles.

Although, she remained leaning as she was before, и it wasn’t immediately that her faint voice returned a question:

"...... Ронье, those ghosts, do you really think that is the case?"

"Eh…………"

After hearing the question, Ронье quickly closed her mouth, feeling like a silly child trying to laugh at something important. The profile of Тейза was as serious as ever, и there was nothing to be joking about. The reason was completely unknown, but Ронье knew, if her best friend is asking seriously, she had to think и answer properly.

Ghost ── Ронье haven’t seen with her own eyes the soul of a human who died in hatred or sorrow wandering without reaching the divine world. Of course, same goes for her mother и grandmothers who let her hear old stories about ghosts.

*Then, even if one says that genuine ghosts appeared hundreds of years ago as it is said in the old tales, it also seems wrong. Because the divine world that the dead human soul is guided to probably does not exist itself. Outside of the Underworld is the Real World which Кирито и Асуна came from, there are no gods there, just humans fighting each other for thousands of years.*

*If the divine world does not exist, this world must be full of ghosts created of the souls of the dead people. But that is not the case, a human soul disappears at the moment of death no matter if it is holding a hatred or sorrow и doesn’t become a ghost.*

Ронье inhaled to express his thoughts.

But just before the voice came out, one scene revived vividly in her mind, и Ронье opened her eyes.

_Я have never seen a scary ghost.    
However, Я have seen a glimpse of a soul of a one who died.  
That was when Кирито was awakened from a long sleep и fiercely fought the man in black cloak<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> who was directing the real world's red knights just before the end of the Войны с Внешним Миром._

At the moment when a huge hatchet held by a black mantle man stroke sparkles from Кирито's Меч и even cut his shoulder a little, Тейза gripped both hands и prayed. *Please, Юдзио-сенпай. Help Кирито-сенпай......* и then.

And as if responding to that voice, a transparent golden arm emerged, supporting the Меч Ночного Неба Кирито was holding. With the help of that hand, Кирито pushed back the crowd и triumphantly fought against the black mantle man. That was without a doubt the hand of the person who should not be in the world anymore — hand of Кирито's best friend, Тейза’s mentor, an elite мечник-стажёр Юдзио.

"....... Тейза............ you............"

Ронье whispered her best friend's name completely forgetting about the ghost thing they were talking just now. She felt like she could finally understand why Тейза stuck to the gossip rumors about the abandoned mansion.

It was the moment when she stretched the right hand to touch the back of Тейза who was looking down.

Faint ── but definite sounds reached their ears; Ронье winced и froze. At the same time Тейза gently lifted her face.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p167.jpg)

It was not a natural sound that they heard. An unpleasant grinding sound like metal и metal rubbing together. Besides, it definitely came from behind the closed door.

Ронье signaled to turned Тейза by putting her index finger to her lips и softly pressed the left ear against the big door.

A few seconds passed, but nothing could be heard. However, that sound was not an illusion.

When she took her face off the door, Тейза, whose face appeared to completely lose the blood, whispered in a very quiet voice.

"...... if we don’t peek inside…"

"............"

Ронье got lost whether she should nod.

Even if the gossip is true, Я cannot believe that ghost is a Тейза's love...... Юдзио. Юдзио lost his life at the top floor of the Центрального Собора и cannot appear at the villa in Император's domain.

And if it was not a ghost but a living human who made a sound, it is highly unlikely that they are innocent public. 

Because it is only those who oppose the authority of the church и the Индекс Табу who is able to go into the mansion, which was closed in the name of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей...... in other words, Церковь Аксиом.

Ронье thought that she should return to Собора now и report it to Кирито or Фанатио, but Тейза moved before she was able to suggest it. She began running towards the Южной along the walls of the house, apparently planning to go around the back of the building. Шимосаки followed her, jumping behind.

"Kururu!!!"

Encouraged by Цукигаке chirping by her feet, Ронье also kicked off the ground.

*Even if she goes to the back door, it should be locked of course. Я do not know what Тейза is going to do, but Я have to stop her before she is going to do something unreasonable.* Even so, she couldn’t catch up with her partner running ten mels ahead.

After she turned around the corner of the mansion twice и entered the backyard, it got dramatically darker. There was also a flower bed in the backyard, but since the sunlight hardly reached it, there were mostly bluish mosses и gray ferns. In the aisle there were broken wheels и decayed trees и there is no way anymore to say it’s the Император's villa.

The back door that Тейза would be aiming was secretly set up on the Северной side of the building. In other words, it would have been closer to reach it from the Северной side instead of the Южной, but Тейза jumped to a small door increasing the run speed even more as if she did not care at all.

She grasped the blue rusted round handle и try to rotate, but just as Ронье expected, only the rusty click sounded. Nevertheless, Тейза continued to pull the handle with force. Even though she was an apprentice, her authority for armor equipment was similar to one of a knight, around 40, so even with pure brute force she could destroy the door. This mansion was handed over from the Император и was by that moment the property of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей, so even in an emergency situation it was not permitted for a knight to damage it without a Council permission.

Ронье, who finally managed to catch up with her friend, quickly pressed Тейза's right hand.

"No Тейза, doors like that will break if you use the power."

"But...... inside, the sound......"

The profile of Тейза who answered in a trembling voice looked strangely pale even in the shade. Having wrapped her cold right hand with both hands, Ронье continued firmly:

"Я heard that sound too. It was not a mishearing. But that's why Я have to be insist."

Ронье gradually removed Тейза’s right hand from the handle и moved<sup><a href="#Prim6">6</a></sup> it by about 1 mel away, then looked around the backyard again.

"...... It might be a ghost in the building, but there is also a possibility that it is not the case. If a living person is entering и leaving the mansion, they should have left a trace somewhere."

Тейза who heard these words nodded a little after blinking several times. The color gradually returned to her relieved face.

"Yup... that's right. Let's examine this neighborhood."

Ронье nodded to her friend who finally regained control, и her gaze continued to wander around.

The dark backyard was narrower than the front one, but still there was a width of 100 mels и a depth of 30 mels. Mossy flower beds were on the right и left sides, и in the center was a pond of unhealthy dark-green color. The passages were heaped with broken trash, with weeds growing high everywhere, shortly speaking, there simply was no good place to start inspection with.

*No, don’t try to find something blindly. First of all, use your head и narrow down the area you should check.*

"...... If there are people coming in и out through this back door..."

Having muttered this, Ронье gazed at the ground in front of the door.

*Would the soil be popping out, we could have looked for footprints; but unfortunately, the passage is tiled with gray cobblestone, just like the front yard is. However, unlike the front yard, the thin layer of moss covers stone here и there. It is not thick enough to have footprints left, but perhaps that ──*

"Тейза, can you look after the dragons for a second?"

"Y-yup."

Ронье waited till Тейза who took a few steps back squatted и put hands on Цукигаке’s и Шимосаки’s backs, then protruded her right hand forward.

"**System Call. Generate Umbra Element.**"

Generated by the incantation was a black extremely small sphere surrounded by blue-violet phosphorescence as if it was a hole in the space. It was the "darkness element", the hardest one to handle among the eight kinds of elements.

As opposed to luminous element, it had a negative nature, so after discharging it would disappear while sucking the surroundings in itself. It’s fine if it happens to water or air, but is really serious if it touches objects or people. However, by utilizing some of it’s properties, it can also be used in a quite different way from other elements.

"**Form element, mist shape.**"

As Ронье continued the incantation, the dark matter disintegrated without a sound, turning into a purple fog. When used for attack, it was usually mixed with the vortex made of aerial element и directed to hit the enemy, but now it is not necessary.

Using both hands, Ронье spread the fog into a flat surface, then whispered:

"**Discharge.**"

The purple mist quickly began to spread ahead.

This fog had the ability of absorbing the sacred power, as well as concealing the reaction. This way, if it’s mixed with aerial element-made tornado, the blades of the wind cut through the enemy's skin, и the fog is left in the wound, silently but steadily sucking out the blood which is the source of sacred power.

And sacred power is not just for humans и animals, but also plants — even for the moss grown over the cobblestone. Of course, it’s amount would be quite modest, but if such moss is hurt by being stepped on multiple times, a small amount of sacred power will be released to surrounding space.

The stripes of released violet mist were drawn to the ground, forming fine twisting branches similar to a plant и shining mysteriously. The shape и the arrangement of it was undoubtedly human footprints. Moreover, from the way it was shining, it was only recently that moss was stepped on.

Footprints extended Северной from the back door of the mansion и disappeared in the forest surrounding the backyard.

"Тейза, over there!"

Ронье quietly exclaimed и rushed after the light drawing the fading footprints.

They turned left at the Северной end of the backyard, entering a cave-like path opening like a mouth in the wall of forest. Because the bush и undergrowth have been cut down, и the obstructing branches were also dropped, it was clearly done by the human hand. In the bottom of the dark wood path, footprints were glowing bright purple.

She stopped at the entrance of the path и whispered to Тейза who has just caught up:

"Be careful, if we come across the owner of footprints, we might be discovered."

"Understood."

Her gaze moved to the feet her nodding friend, where two serious looking young dragons also winced ears. Since it is possible that there may be a battle with the footprints owner should they proceed this way, it would be best to have dragons stayed, but she couldn’t say that the backyard of the mansion was safe.

Judging that there was no choice but to take them along, Ронье bent backward.

"You guys keep quiet."

After she lightly stroke the head of Цукигаке who responded with a quiet **Ку-ру-ру**, the dragon slowly stretched the back.

Another glance at the footpath revealed that the footprints of light had already disappeared, but there was no danger of getting lost due to the size of the forest. They with Тейза nodded to each other и stepped inside together.

Just after a few mels on the dark path the air became freezingly cold. That day was warm manifesting the soon coming of spring, but the air the darkness exhaled seemed to be colored midwinter-white.

*Я have bad feeling*, thought Ронье. The throne in the Норлангарт castle to which they rushed together with Тейза at the time of the Rebellion of Four Империиs was filled with same heavy air. It was not just cold, it rather felt that the cold air soaking in the walls и floor for a long time somehow deprived the warmth.

The two-thirty bell haven’t rung yet, but the darkness was steadily increasing as they proceeded. Both sides of the path were blocked by a hedge with sharp thorns, и more и more branches of old trees overlapped above their heads.

*What if it gets darker even more, и Я can’t use the light element’s light.....*. she thought, и then:

"Ah...... Ронье, there!"

Тейза sharply whispered, Ронье also stared ahead.

In the depths of the darkness, there was a number of vertically standing metal rods. The first guess would be that they reached the iron fence surrounding the forest. However, that was the iron gate rather than a fence. There was a small building, about of a shrine’s size, in the end of the path, и the gate was the front door bars.

They halted, making sure that there are no signs of people around, then carefully approached.

"... this building, it is quite old...."

Like Тейза murmured, the stone walls looked dusty are blackened as if exposed to the wind и rain, и moss was covering the areas touching the ground, appeared that in ten-twenty years’ time this won’t stand anymore without proper support. A high double iron gate was also thin и covered with rust, it didn’t seem that a high priority material would be decaying so much.

The left и right doors fitted together without any gaps, и a sturdy lock was installed about one mel from the ground. Pulling the iron grid with both hands gently, as expected, did not break them open. On the other side of the door there was a staircase descending below the ground, ending with the complete darkness.

"It's locked here too."

Тейза replied to Ронье’s words with a regretful face.

"And yet there’s something inside, for sure......."

That tone, radiating with the same emotions she felt recently, made Ронье relieved a little bit. Of course, it did not mean that the fear of ghosts has gone, but someone who is coming in и out through the back door of the mansion was obviously not ghost, but a living being. Perhaps, the same people who made sounds in the mansion.

*As an apprentice knight I’d very much like to identify the person who is breaking the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей's no-entry ban и catch this villain — but that does not mean Я can destroy the lock. There is no crime committed in front of my eyes.*

*It’s a pity*, Ронье thought, *but there is no choice but to go back to the Собора и report the situation и get back with someone of the senior knights*. But Тейза exclaimed the same she said just now:

"Ah....... over there!"

She pointed to the wall on the right side of the descending staircase with her right hand protruding into the gap in the iron grating. Ронье also brought her face close to the gate, staring into the deeps of the darkness.

There was something blinking around the seventh step down the stairs. A broken nail stuck in a wall, something of a dull silver color hanging on a string over it, something elongated......

"…………key!"

They exclaimed together и exchanged looks.

It was probably a duplicate key prepared for the time when someone gets locked inside by chance. In other words, this exotic grid door was to prevent intrusion from the outside.

At the same time, they both tried to reach out through the gap in the grid, but since the width of the gap was only ten cens, only a shoulder would fit и the key would be out of reach.

"... an "arm of mind" could be used here......."

Overall, one could agree with Тейза's groaning voice, but if you are able to do so, it’s rather worth trying to invoke Кирито’s "Pick of Mind". Looked around, for something like a long bar, but there was no such thing falling conveniently.

But, on the other hand, they’d need to find a bar about 3 mel length, to take the key out from the outside, so it appears to be an unlikely story to happen. *If you keep a duplicate key, why should it stay so far down the staircase?*

When Ронье thought again, what on earth this building is exactly, that happened.

That moment they heard the dragon's roaring "Ку-ру-ру-ру.......". Looking down, they saw the light-blue feathered Шимосаки trying to thrust his body into the gap in the grid. Тейза who saw it asked, worriedly:

"Hey Шимосаки, you think you can get through this gap...?"

But before she finished, Цукигаке’s head showed Шимосаки's back. The body of the young dragon passed through the gap at once, и after one full somersault, he stood up in front of the staircase.

"Кю-ру-ру!!!"

Шимосаки proudly chirped, и although some rust stuck to his feathers, there seemed to be no injury. It looked wide due to fluffy fur и feathers, but the body of the young dragon in reality was still small.

"Good grief, what a self-esteem......."

Тейза lightly scolded him, but a smile of proudness appeared on her lips. Pointing at the key with her right hand thrusted into the iron grid, she instructed the beloved dragon:

"Шимосаки, can you get it?"

Of course, chirping again in the response, Шимосаки went down the stairs и stopped right under the nail.

The height to the key was about 1.8 mel. While leisurely flapping small wings, it jumped once, twice и succeeded in picking up the key at the third time. After coming back to triumphantly, it protruded a thin nose through the grid gap.

Тейза received the key held in the mouth, handed it over to Ронье, и began stroking the head of the dragon with both hands. Who, after observing the scene, inserted the old key into the keyhole of the iron grating. Although, as expected, it was bit hard, the key eventually turned around, then a click и a hard sound echoed.

She waited for Тейза to go one step back и pulled the grid towards herself. The door moved squeaking **ki-i-i-i**. Шимосаки who was waiting inside flapped the wings as soon as they came in.

Since the door was opened, they had to find out what was in the basement, but once again looking into the darkness under the stairs, Ронье felt sweat spreading over her palms.

*Я do not like the disjunctive way the high-priority iron grid key was hanging just out of reach. Я do not think it is a trap to lure an intruder into the basement — but if so, they wouldn’t have to lock it, to start with — и Я cannot predict what is inside so far.*

Ронье lifted the line of sight from Цукигаке, rubbing her body against the feet as if sharing the owner's anxiety, to Тейза, и suggested:

"Hey, Тейза. Я will check it down, so you can stay here..."

"Declined, Я will go too, of course."

She distinctly shook her head, denying the option to wait outside with the dragons.

"……all right. But be careful, OK?"

"Sure."

Saying so Тейза encouragingly smiled, и Ронье smiled in response и walked up to the bush on the left. Chose a branch without thorns и broke it. Generated a light element и fixed it to the leaf at the tip of the branch by the "**adhere**" phrase.

Embracing Цукигаке with the left arm, she raised the newly-created torch with her right hand и stepped into the building. After waiting for Тейза и Шимосаки to enter, she closed the door и locked it again. She could bring the key along, but it might indicate the intrusion, so she returned it to the nail which was located just beneath the ground level.

The descending stairs were longer than could be imagined. There was a landing after they descended thirty steps, и then it went for another thirty, where it finally turned into a flat aisle. Since the height of one step was about 20 cen, it could be counted as about 12 mels underground. For Собора, that would be equal to a height of a third floor.

The air was somewhat warmer than outside, but also damp и moldy. In truth, they first thought that there might be a hidden treasure chest of the Император Норлангарт stored in the basement, but if someone keeps it in such a place, the treasure box will lose its Life in a few years и it will decay into trash.

After about 50 meters, the long underground passageway turned to the right. Finally, they saw a weak light ahead. But it was not a relief. Whatever the light source was, there must be someone who ignited it.

There was still a distance of over 30 mel to the light, but Ронье saw the other one giving her a sign и stopped. No noise or talk could be heard at that moment. When she carefully tried to resume advancement, her cloak hood was lightly pulled behind.

She startled, winced и turned around.

"……What's wrong?"

To that whispered question, Тейза looked up at the ceiling of the aisle with a difficult expression. Ронье also looked upwards, but she could only see the same stone-cladding as the wall was made of.

Тейза muttered, frowning:

"Went from the backyard СевернойЗападной, entered the forest... descended from that small shrine to the basement, turned back once....... ── Ронье, is this not the basement of the mansion by any chance?"

"Ehm…………"

After hearing her words, Ронье also imagined the plan of the manor и the forest. She nodded slowly after blinking.

"Yeah, that's right...... what is wrong with that?"

"Because...... isn’t it weird? If it's a basement of a mansion, you only need to make a staircase to the building... Why would you have an entrance in the forest several tens of mels away?"

*To say the truth, Тейза's made a good point. Again, a sense of discomfort revived after thoughts of a key fitting to the metal grid hanging near the entrance, but even if you think it all over, the answer will not come out.*

"Maybe we'll find out if we take a look at what’s down there..."

When Ронье responded in whispering, her partner muttered "well...". After all that happened so far, they couldn’t turn back without having checked every corner of the basement.

After this exchange, two people with two animals began tiptoeing Южной along the passage.

Up ahead, the yellow light was vaguely trembling. Concentrating on the musty smell, it could be noticed that it contained a burning aroma unique to oil lanterns. и some faint different smell, too.

Цукигаке, still held under the left arm, also protruded the twitching snout. While feeling as though it was a smell smelt somewhere, they kept tiptoeing on.

Eventually, turned out the light was produced by two oil lanterns attached to the wall on the right. The passage was a dead end, but just before it, there seemed to be something on the left wall. It was another grate shinning dully up ahead in the light of the lanterns — no, it was rather…

"...... P-prison...?"

— whispered Тейза, Ронье slightly nodded to her.

It was too big for a door. The iron lattice extending from the floor to the ceiling was exactly like that in the cellar of the Южной Центория Guards building. There were two large cells of about four meters wide, placed side by side. The corner blocked the view of what’s inside.

Moving ahead steadily, back against the left wall. As they approach the prison, the mysterious smell became stronger. *It is something like a worn leather armor, like dried straw in the sun. Same smell Я smelt... somewhere in the Тёмной Территории, not Мира Людей.......*

Before the answer came to her, Ронье reached the closest cell и stopped before it. Together with Цукигаке she embraced, they both slowly stuck heads out from behind the wall и peeked inside.

The light of lanterns hanging on the opposite wall was too weak, и did not reach into the depth of the cell. After gently inserting the lit branches, she quickly understood that it is not empty inside. At the far corner from Ронье, three prisoners could be seen. It seemed, they were sleeping, huddled.

The bodies wrapped in some rags were quite short. All of them were under the half a mel. *Children...... no, their arms are too long for the case. Hairless heads, sharp noses и ears.  
They are neither children nor a Мира Людей person.  
They are гоблинов.*

She recoiled, biting hard the branch in her right hand. In a second, Тейза’s face appears near.

"What's wrong....... Was there anyone?"

Ронье nodded several times to this whisper. Exhaled, then sucked in air deeply through the nose. There was no doubt, this mix of the dry straw aroma и the common body odor she smelled in the past, at the time of visiting the mountain гоблинов.

"There are...... mountain гоблинов, three of them. Я think they are the tourists who were taken away from the Inn in Южной Центория."

"Eh…………"

Тейза rounded her eyes и looked into the prison, clinging to Ронье's body. She returned to the original position in about three seconds и nodded.

"It's really the case... but... how...? How did гоблинов kidnapped in Южной Центория end up in the Северной Империи Император's domain?"

This question could not be answered right away.

*In order to move from Южной Центория to Северной Центория, one would need to go through Восточной Центория or Западной Центория и in this case they must cross the "timeless wall" twice. To go through the gate which is provided only one per city, it is necessary to have a traffic pass or a one-day passage permit, и of course, neither pass nor permit is easy to obtain.*

*No, a fake official who abducted the гоблинов would fake the identity of the Южной Центория administration, so they might be capable of faking permits as well, but even so, the question remains as to why they took the risk of being stopped at the gate to bring them to the Северной Империи. There is also a vast land in the Южной Империи, и there should be enough places to hide the гоблинов.*

"...... let’s think about it later."

Having muttered this mostly to herself, Ронье looked at Тейза’s face.

"We have to bring those three out of here и take them to Собора."

"Yeah... but look, there is a lock on the prison, is not it?"

It was as Тейза pointed out. They quickly looked over the surrounding walls but, as expected, it was not possible to find the key again. However, the situation was quite different from the previous one.

Tourists from Тёмной Территории, taken away by a fake official, are imprisoned in front of one’s eyes. It is an obvious rebellion against the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей, even the own judgment of apprentices Ронье и Тейза was enough to draw the conclusion.

"Я will break the cell."

Having said so, Ронье touched the handle of Меч of the Moonlight with her right hand.

*The material of the prison’s iron grid is probably the same as the one of the ground-level entrance gate. But the Меч’s priority should not lose. Whether you can cut through or not depends on the skill of the user.*

"... Я understood. Please do it, Ронье."

Тейза who smiled for a moment, looked into the prison again.

"But we should wake up гоблинов before that. They will be scared if you suddenly use the secret skill."

"Well..."

Although Тейза's fear is reasonable, it was unexpectedly challenging to quietly awake the гоблинов who might have fallen asleep as they were exhausted. If they scream, the kidnappers in the house above would be alarmed.

Of course, it is not silent to cut through the iron grid with a Меч either, but if you use the fastest secret technique Ронье knew — и if it is completely successful, it will be suppressed to a quiet metal sound. Because of this, the гоблинов must be awakened in advance.

After squatting down on the floor, Ронье released Цукигаке on her left arm. It happened when she put both hands around her mouth и was about to gently call the sleeping гоблинов.

A loud noise echoed through the passage, as if some heavy things were grinding.

At the same time as Ронье и Тейза abruptly rose back to the standing postures, the three mountain гоблинов jumped up in the prison и began to shout after noticing Ронье who was in front of the iron grid.

**"Giiii**!!!"

"Stop it, not hurt more!"

The three of them, apparently handled quite roughly when imprisoned, embraced each other hard и shuddered. It would be necessary to explain that they came to help, but the timing was off.

The wall at the end of the aisle they thought that it was a dead end was slowly rising with the roaring sound. Hidden door ── no doubt the sound faintly heard at the front door of the mansion was the same sound.

And the fact that the door was opening meant that someone was going to enter the dungeon from there.

There was no place where they could hide themselves in the aisle. Since the turning bend behind was more than 30 mel away, they already could not run away in time.

"...... There is no choice but to fight."

— Тейза sharply whispered close to the ear of frozen Ронье.

That was exactly right. If you cannot hide, the only remaining option is to fight or to surrender. The question is only which one to choose.

Ронье и Тейза simultaneously pulled out Мечs from their left hips и held them with both hands.

On the floor, widely spreading the wings, just in front of Ронье's feet — apparently preparing to fight defending her owner — Цукигаке, и next to her, at Тейза's feet, Шимосаки stood quickly.

"Цукигаке, Шимосаки, get into the cell now и stay quiet!"

Young dragons leaked unhappy "Ку-ру-ру......", but obeyed the order. First, Цукигаке squeezed through the gap in the iron grid. Rattling the grating with both legs, she bent the body to go through the gap, и rolled up in the center of the cell. Mountain гоблинов let out a quiet yelp at the back of the cell, but soon they were able to see that it was a harmless creature.

Next, Шимосаки tried to go through the grid. The hidden door was already half-lifted, и white-smoke-cold air flowed out of the darkness on the other side. The darkness was too dense, it wasn’t possible to see the appearance of the one who was behind the door, but the presence felt somehow familiar.

"Шимосаки, hurry!"

To Тейза’s voice, Шимосаки responded in a pained growl. Apparently, the gap of the grid was slightly narrower than the door on the ground. Цукигаке, who was somewhat smaller due to fish dislike, managed to pass through but the joint of Шимосаки’s wing got stuck.

She thought about pushing by hand, but if it is done too aggressively, one might break delicate wing bones. While she was hesitating, the door opened more и more.

"Шимосаки, you're good! Behind us!"

Тейза shouted again without hesitation while holding the Меч ready. Шимосаки also answered "Ку-ру", pulled the body out from the iron grid и ran behind the two of them.

At last the hidden door lifted almost to the very ceiling и stopped with a loud sound.

A few seconds later, they heard **ko-ts**, a shuffling, dry sound of footsteps. **Ko-ts**, **ko-ts**, then steps over the stone floor, someone was approaching from inside the darkness.

Ронье hardly kept the impulse of slashing them with the secret skill before she could see the figure appearing. That would be not a knight’s but a coward’s action, besides, once the person is killed you won’t know the identity of the opponent or the reason for abducting the mountain гоблинов.

After several seconds that felt tremendously long passed, finally someone appeared in the weak light of oil lantern.

His appearance was completely black, as if the darkness itself had crystallized into a human figure. Before she understood that he was just wearing a jet-black robe, Ронье wasn’t sure for a moment, whether it was a really living person or not.

*── No, it is a human.  
Moreover, one of a remarkable appearance.*

The one who kidnapped Lisetta, the daughter of the Тёмной Территории commander Isukan и ambassador Шейта, the man in the black robe. The human figure in front of her emanated exactly the same atmosphere as the one, whether a human, or a demon, whom she opposed on the sealed top floor of Obsidia Castle.

*However, it is impossible.*

Only three days have passed since the kidnapper in the black robe jumped out of the Obsidia castle window и disappeared. The distance from Obsidia to Центория is more than 3,000 kilolu. To move between them, it takes half a year on foot, three months in a carriage, и two weeks even for a horse messenger moving quickly through ten connected towns и villages. In order to move in three days, one only had to use a dragon, but if one flies a dragon that is not owned by Рыцари Целостности over the Мира Людей, it would have made a big fuss.

*Is it the same person, or is this one just close enough to their counterpart?*

Trying to find the material to judge it, Ронье desperately looked him over.

The kidnapper had his right arm cut off with a Меч of ambassador Шейта called "silent knight", и immediately after that his left arm was slashed with Ронье's Incrad secret move "Sonic Leap". A high-level Sacred Art practitioner could regenerate arms и legs by healing techniques but certain awkwardness in motion should still remain for как минимум one week.

But the black robe man — still unclear whether or not it was him ─ stopped after making one step ahead и did not move anymore. From the darkness behind the deep hood, only his eyes glittered, fixed on Ронье и Тейза.

*Estimates our attitude...... or, is he waiting for something......?*

Ронье thought this way, firmly grasping the Меч of the Moonlight with both hands.

*Whatever the man is waiting for, there is no reason for us to play along. If he is truly the same person as the kidnapper in Obsidia, the man would use poison. Rather than just wait for him to use something he’s got, we should hit first action here.*

They didn’t kill him, though. Ронье would slash the enemy's right leg и Тейза would slash his left leg to take away the ability to fight.

When Ронье moved a little to the left, Тейза instantly realized her intent и swung the Меч in the opposite direction.

In order to execute Incrad style secret move "Slant" at the same time, they had to align breath. Inhale, exhale и inhale again.

Ронье tried to move the moment she felt she was in complete sync with her best friend.

However, as if to steal that last breath, the black robe man moved with perfect timing.

Had he attacked, Ронье и the other one would have executed the secret moves without any hesitation. However, the man quite casually lifted both hands, и merely swept the black hood behind. The breathing was disturbed, и Ронье slightly drew the Меч tip back.

Almost at the same time, a low voice sounded.

"Unwelcomed guests. Or... should Я call it God Vector's guiding hand?"

That low, rusty voice was familiar. It was quite different from Obsidia kidnapper’s gentle breeze-like voice.

The movement of both hands lifting the hood was also smooth, и above all, Ронье was familiar to the man’s face.

A fierce и violent appearance reminiscent of a bird of prey. Gray mustache и beard with sharply pointed tip. Pair of eyes shining in the light-blue like a frozen lake.

"...... Y-you’ve got to......"

— Тейза muttered in trembling voice.

Ронье also wanted to say exactly the same.

Норлангарт Северной Империи Sixth Император, Крюгер Норлангарт....

A bursting with flames decoration hanging on the jet-black wall, distant sounds of Меч fight — the memories revived vividly.

*But, this is impossible. Император Крюгер certainly died by the throne in the throne hall of the Imperial Palace, just about a year ago.*

Ронье и Тейза were engaged in the seesaw Меч fight directly with the Император, who attacked in the High Norkia style, which boasts the power of a blow, although the cooldown is also long, for more than five minutes. Then Дюсольберт, who came late, shoot the Император's right leg with a fire arrow from his Divine Object Conflagrant Flame Bow, so when his movement stopped, Ронье и the other one without missing a moment simultaneously executed their secret moves, deeply penetrating the Император's right и left sides of chest.

There is no human being able to live with such wounds. The death of the Император was also confirmed by Дюсольберт, the body was taken to the Собора, и brought to cremation with the other two Императорs. Ронье certainly saw that the remnants of the Император became grains of divine power и melted away in the air.

Therefore, Император Крюгер simply couldn’t be alive.

Yet the man in a black robe in front of them could not be thought of as anyone else except for the Император Крюгер himself.

Ронье has become numb и could neither move nor talk. The field of view narrowed, the sense of the body disappeared. Only the man's severe icy eyes were getting bigger и bigger.

Because she was in such a state of paralysis.

To a faint sound she heard from behind, the response was delayed.

*── Footsteps...... unexpected...... enemy!*

As these fragmentary thoughts sparked in her mind, Ронье quickly turned around while turning her left hand towards the man who had the face of the Император. But at that time, another black robe man who was quietly creeping unnoticed until getting in the close vicinity abruptly jumped back.

And the man's left hand was gripping the neck of the young dragon wrapped in blue feathers.

"Gyu-ру-ру-u!!!"

— the dragon screamed painfully.

"Шимосаки!!!"

— Тейза cried out with a grieving voice.

Both of them were constantly talking to Цукигаке и Шимосаки since the moment the eggs the mother-dragon "Akisomi"<sup><a href="#Prim7">7</a></sup> was brooding, finally hatched, essentially, they spent eight months together. There was absolutely nothing that could hurt more.

Тейза tried to jump to the man in a black robe straight away, but froze on the spot just like Ронье did, after making a step ahead.

The man put a large knife he held in his right hand to the base of Шимосаки's neck.

The blade of the knife was dyed reddish green, и it was clear at first sight that the color came from poison. Шимосаки himself also seemed to sense the danger, stopped struggling.

The man retreated silently without saying a word и stopped in more than five mels away from them. Anyway, they couldn’t move a finger in this situation.

"You are knights, but care about that lizard."

The Император Крюгер standing in front of the hidden door — or как минимум the man with his face и voice, began talking, sneering sarcastically.

"Is it not just an animal after all? There will be many alternatives, Я find it hard to understand."

"...... You don’t need to understand anything."

— Тейза answered with a voice that pushed the pressure away.

"Tell him to let Шимосаки go. If you scratch as much as his hair, none of you two will get outta here alive."

"Ку-Ку-ku, becoming a knight, one also gains power."

After letting out a gruesome laugh, the Император-like man traced the left side of his chest with his finger. A year ago, that place was deeply penetrated by Тейза’s Меч.

"But unfortunately, it is myself who gives orders here. Both of you, throw down Мечs и slide them away with your feet. If you do anything even a little strange, the head of the baby lizard will fall."

*── At that time your neck will fall as well.*

She would respond this way, but even if the opponent is a true Император Крюгер, they couldn’t afford risking Шимосаки's life. Ронье turned the gaze of her squinted eyes to Тейза и slightly nodded to her.

Together they dropped the released Мечs onto the floor. While apologizing to the Мечs in the mind, they carefully hooked Мечs with tips of boots и gently slid them to the Император.

The Император picked two Мечs with the right foot appearing from under the hem of robe и casually kicked them behind the hidden door. The silver glow glinted in the dense darkness и disappeared.

"Good. Now, the next order."

With his right hand he took out a shiny black key of the robe's bosom. и threw it to Ронье. Reflectively she caught it with both hands. Despite it was supposed to have been in the pocket for a long time, the key was as cold as ice.

"Open the cell next to the гоблинов, get inside, close the door и lock it."

Ронье was considering a plan of approaching the Император when he picks up the Меч to dispose of it и thus loses the focus, capturing him with bare hands и using the hostage to make the man behind to release Шимосаки. However, the Император calmly kept the distance и did not move. Quickly glancing behind she saw the poison blade still put against the neck of Шимосаки who had to endure it, struggling occasionally.

They understood that escape will be difficult once they enter the cell, but they had no choice but to obey.

Ронье signaled Тейза with eyes, they approached an empty cell in the back of the left side. She unlocked the door with the key she got и entered inside together with her friend. Closed the door, thrusting the hand through the gaps in the lattice, inserting the key into the keyhole и turning it to the right.

*To pretend it is locked и in fact to leave it in an unlocked state...... Я guess, that is probably impossible. The words Кирито said: "The key и keyhole of this world is systematic rather than mechanical mechanism" are reviving in the mind.*

_The sacred word "**system**" in the context of Sacred Art is a word meaning "the principle of the world". The key master, given a Sacred Task inherited from generation to generation, from parents to children, makes a keyhole by punching the iron plate with family-specific chisel, then makes a key from the iron scraps from the same plate, и it is only because so is determined by the principle of this world that only the pair of those key и keyhole functions as a combination, Я guess, that’s what Кирито meant. For this very reason, there are only two positions of a key: "locked" и "unlocked", и there is no way to fake a state when it looks as if it is locked, but will be unlocked with a strong shock._

As Ронье turned the key to the right, at certain point she felt a kind of resistance, и eventually a ruthless sound **ga-chin** was heard. Having pulled the key out, she threw it back the Император.

Император Крюгер who caught it with a pale right hand smiled again while returning the key to the bosom of robe.

"Ку-ku... quite a wise decision. Я wouldn’t want to defile this historic place with lizard blood."

"...!!!"

Placing the left hand on the shoulder of Тейза who was about to shout in anger, Ронье asked in a quiet voice.

"Historic......? It looks like just a dungeon."

Then the Император picked a sharp chin beard with his fingertips и nodded.

"It is certainly just a dungeon. However, the stone you are stepping on, for over 300 years had soaked in a lot of blood. The blood of many people of my territory, punished by the aristocratic judgement right....... "

"............!"

Ронье stopped breathing и dropped the gaze to the dark floor stone by her feet.

The aristocrat judgement right was a privilege given only to the Император и the senior aristocrats, to punish those who misconducted at their own discretion. Although only the lower aristocrats и the private territory commoners were the subject to punishment, Ронье's father, who was the sixth-class nobleman, seemed to have been humiliated several times due to punishment caused by higher aristocrats’ accusations.

But even aristocrats could not violate the Индекс Табу, which prohibited the deprivation of the other's Life without a reason. Because of that, the aristocrats’ personal punishment was an exception. But even Рыцари Целостности, who had been granted the greatest rights in Мира Людей, were restricted to a maximum of 70% of Life they could take away while punishing sinners.

"...... The punishment that makes the floor dyed so much would be a violation of the Индекс Табу."

When Ронье pointed that out in hoarse voice, the Император laughed again:

"Ku, Ку-Ку-ku... There are countless methods such of how to get around that full of holes Index. It can be even said that the entire history of the Императорs of the four Империиs и of a senior aristocracy existed only due to the exploitation of that method."

The moment she heard the words, the abominable memory ripped her mind like a lightning flash in the dark night.

Former elite мечник-стажёр Raios Antinous tried to trap Ронье и Тейза at the time when they were students, и then disgrace them using aristocratic judgment right as shield. This way his father, 3rd-class aristocrat brought him up, и the father of his father, и it can only be imagined how sneaky и unscrupulous acts were happening in their private territories.

Especially, if a person is the Император Норлангарт, standing above all the aristocrats ──

"... Didn’t you wonder, girl? Why is there an underpass to the forest in the back yard while there is also a door leading to the mansion?"

Unexpectedly asked, Ронье looked at the face of the Император through the iron grid.

With the faint smile burning under the thin mustache, the Император said without waiting for an answer.

"Of course, it's to bring out the dead bodies, so that the blood of those filthy serfs does not defile the house."

"W-what?!"

— Тейза shouted. She rushed to the grid with the full speed her body allowed for и grasped the steel rods with both hands.

A wave of anger run through the whole body of Ронье. The man in front of her ── or rather whole his family, since long ago had been confining their private territory dwellers to this prison, slipped around the Индекс Табу и tortured them, taking life after life.

The metal grating on the ground found by the two people was not to prevent intrusion from the outside. That door was opened to bring out the corpses of innocent people from the underground dungeon from the inside. That is why the key was hanging in an unusual place. Because if you think about it, there is no chance someone would sneak with mАлиса into the Император's house within the Император’s territory.

Even though Тейза was an apprentice of an Рыцарь Целостности, when she pulled the iron grid with all her strength, the grill only slightly creaked. Imagining how the private territory dwellers trapped here before desperately grabbed the grid, Ронье felt more и more anger rising in her trembling body.

However, at that time, a man in black robe who captured Шимосаки appeared without any sound from the right side of the aisle и stood behind the Император. After seeing the poisoned knife left on the neck of the young dragon, Тейза released the grid.

Whether because he got tired struggling, Шимосаки was looking limp, и only thinly squeaked "Kyuii..." noticing his owner. The moment she heard the voice, Тейза also leaked a thin и short sobbing, и tears filled Ронье’s eyes.

But she made herself to hold any loud sound.

Цукигаке was hiding in the neighboring cell separated only with a stone wall. She is now following the previously received instructions of staying quiet, but if Ронье gave vent to the feelings Цукигаке would not be able to endure as well. She might even jump out of the prison и try to save her brother-dragon<sup><a href="#Prim8">8</a></sup> from the man in the black robe. The situation seems to be already bad, but if Цукигаке is caught, the possibility of escape would be considerably lower.

*── So please remain quiet, Цукигаке.*

While sending these thoughts through a thick stone wall, Ронье desperately tried to suppress her anger.

That moment Император Крюгер has turned his sharp glance at her as if he had read the thoughts.

"...... Black-haired girl, didn’t you bring your little lizard?"

Тейза replied instead of Ронье who could only silently nod because of this surprise attack, still holding the grid.

"...... Today, we came to catch some fish in the lake to correct that child's fish dislike. Ронье's dragon is waiting in the Собора."

"Oh.... You girls do not know, but there are five kinds of fish living in Lake Norkia. Я allowed to fish four of them, but those who caught a forbidden golden trout quickly got into this prison."

Тейза refuted to the Император who said that in a nostalgic tone.

"...... It would be impossible to fish only certain fish."

"Aha, it is impossible. But the hungry people had nothing else left but to fish, praying that the most delicious golden trout would not hang on the hook. Only one could be caught per about three hundred fish, but given good fortune.... no, bad fortune, it was a real pleasure to watch   from the lakeshore the sorrow of those who had it enough to catch the forbidden fish."

While staring at the Император laughing gutturally “Ku! Ku! Ku!”, Ронье had to endure her fierce anger once again.

Certainly, violations of the Индекс Табу и Imperial Law were mostly accidental cases. It was natural since one had to break the "seal of the right eye" to deliberately disobey the law, but this had nothing to do with an unreasonable punishment due to a bad luck one couldn’t even avoid with their own will. Besides, the Император was pushing his private territory dwellers to attract that bad luck. Essentially it was the same as when Raios Antinous provoked Ронье и Тейза to be able to apply the aristocratic judging right.

After a long laughing, the Император turned his gaze away.

"Hmm, it seems that there is only one lizard indeed, but I’ll keep this one for now. Worry not, it will be fine...... unless you try to escape from the prison, in which case I’ll roast и let the гоблинов eat it."

Having said so, Император Крюгер turned towards the hidden door.

But then stopped there и glanced at Шимосаки whose neck was still held by his subordinate.

"....... Зеппос, do you think the lizard can pass through the cell grid?"

Ронье's heart made a giant leap. A man in black robe named Зеппос lifted Шимосаки up to his face и inspected him carefully, then said with a surprisingly shrill voice.

"If forcibly pushed in, maybe."

"Is that so?"

The Император nodded и lifted the oil lantern from the wall и directed it towards the cell with Ронье и Тейза. His sharp gaze browsed through every corner, then he nodded again as if satisfied.

*Leave it и go away*, Ронье prayed. However, the Император turned right instead of the left и walked in front of the next cell.

Цукигаке was hiding in the dark in the corner, but if illuminated with a lantern, pale yellow feathers will be seen instantly. She could distract them somehow, but calling them would probably result in a negative effect only earning several tens of seconds, which would be meaningless.

*──Цукигаке, if you’re found, do your best to get to the door at the ground и run away!*

Ронье clenched fists hoping her thoughts reach the addressee.

Император standing in front of the neighboring cell lifted the right hand with the lantern. Frowned, stretched his neck и began to persistently look around the inside of the cell.

Three seconds passed...... five seconds... ten seconds.

"............ Hm"

Having shortly snouted, the Император moved away from the grid. He returned the lantern to the holder on the wall, и returned behind the hidden door without even glancing at Ронье и the other one. Behind him followed a man called Зеппос still holding Шимосаки.

Some time has passed since the silhouettes of those two persons vanished, и a quiet sound "**ga-kon**" was heard from the deeps of the darkness, after which the hidden door lifted to the ceiling started to fall with the roaring.

When the lower end of the door touched the floor with the earthy sound, Ронье suddenly breathed out the air she was holding. Тейза released both hands which were grasping the iron grid all the time, quickly approached Ронье и pressed the forehead against her shoulder.

"... It's gonna be fine, Шимосаки......"

Ронье nodded several times to this hoarse voice:

"Of course, Шимосаки is an important hostage for them, they will never hurt him."

"…………Uhu."

After stroking Тейза's back few times, Ронье gently released her body. She approached the iron grid carefully и spoke to the right cell with a quietest voice:

"Thank you, гоблинов-сан."

For quite a while silence continued, but eventually a similar whispering voice was heard:

"...... Tiny dragon, cannot find."

That's right — there was only one reason why Император Крюгер could not find Цукигаке in a small cell. The mountain гоблинов who gave frightened voice when Цукигаке got into the cell, hid her from the eyes of the Император using their bodies.

"Thank you very much……"

When she thanked them again, there was also a quiet chirping "Ку-ру".

Цукигаке who passed through the iron grid back appeared in front of Ронье. When the young dragon tried to push the body through the grid again, Ронье crouched и pushed him back with both hands.

"Цукигаке, Я beg you. Go along this aisle to the ground и get to the Северной gate of Центория somehow...... when guards-сан see you, they will take you to the Собора."

It was a difficult order for the young dragon only eight months old. Lake Norkia was ten kilolu away from the Северной Центория, и it was not easy to get out of this villa to the high road either. Moreover, since they have already walked quite a lot that day, Ронье did not know how much his Life will decrease before reaching the central capital. In the worst case, he might just collapse on the way.

But that moment, Цукигаке was the only hope remaining. It was probably impossible to break the grid without a Меч, и even if they do somehow it would certainly be noticed by the Император, и Шимосаки might be killed.

While suffering from strong anxiety, she wrapped Цукигаке's body with both hands thrusted through the gaps in the grid. The young dragon chirped "Please leave it to me" or perhaps something alike in response.

She retreated back from Ронье’s hands, flapped the wings twice, и then started running Северной along the aisle. Soon her figure disappeared и the clinking footsteps tailed away.

"...... I’m sorry...... but please, Цукигаке."

Knelt on a hard stone, Ронье gripped both hands и prayed.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>It is the default for Западной world that dragons fly. That’s why no translators of SAO Я ever read made an accent on it. However, in Japan, the dragon (竜, ryū) defaults to a prolonged Chinese dragon, which may not necessary fly at all. In these books all “dragons” of Рыцари Целостности, i.e. all dragons in Underworld — except, perhaps, for that legendary one depicted on the magic comb Асуна used — are “flying dragons” (飛竜, hiryū), which are more the traditional “euro-standard” dragons. Further Я will continue to use just word “dragon” referring to the dragons we all know.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Тейза uses ансоку-ничи (安息日) which has a distinct meaning of Judaic Sabbath, but since it’s кандзи и not katakana, she probably doesn’t refer to the name of day itself, nor to a term (as Underworld people know nothing of other religions), but rather to the fact that it’s the last day of week when people rest.
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>Я guess あっやしいなぁー can also mean that she doesn’t like the whole idea in the first place, и in fact it’s probably both.
4. <a name="Prim4"></a>Yes Я am aware it’s still late February, several days after snow melted.
5. <a name="Prim5"></a>Ронье doesn’t know about a concept of ‘poncho’ so here we have ‘cloak’ in her thoughts. Same for ‘O-nata’ (Great Knife of Pyramidhead from Silent Hill) becoming ‘kyodaina-nata’, (simply huge hatchet) below.
6. <a name="Prim6"></a>The original says “lowered” but given both girls should be under 160 cm (you remember the 180 cm "giant", don't you?), you’ll have nightmares if you try imagining that.
7. <a name="Prim7"></a>暁染, Color-of-the-dawn. Я wonder, however, if アキソミ was an attempt to encode “Axiom” in the dragon name convention format (2 characters, 4 syllables, ending with “-i” — of which Цукигаке is the only exception Я know), which would raise more questions about this never-heard-of-before dragon.
8. <a name="Prim8"></a>Worth noting, 兄竜 confirms that a) Шимосаки is male, и b) Шимосаки is older than Цукигаке.
