# Part 5

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

From the 20th to the 30th floor of Центрального Собора there were residences of staff, Sacred Art masters и knights.

The room where Асуна и Кирито lived was in the southeastern corner of the of the thirtieth floor. Coincidentally, it was the same arrangement as the inn room in the South Центория borrowed at six hundred sheers per day, but the sizes were not comparable.

Opening a thick door from the corridor, one first gets into an entrance room of about four tatamis size, и behind it, separated with another door, lies a huge living room of thirty tatamis size.

There are high windows with a grid on the south wall, from floor to near the ceiling, a complete kitchen и a bathroom are on the west side, и a spacious bedroom is on the east side. It is not as good as living room, but it is still about 15 tatamis<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>.

However, in Мира Людей / Underworld, the unit "tatami" was not used. To begin with, there were no татами mats at least in Собора и North Центория. The size of the boarded or tiled floor was only expressed in square mel и square kilolu, и they were also abbreviated as "he-mel" и "he-kilolu", respectively. According to this, is the living room size was about 50 he-mels.

*Cleaning this large one would be a serious task*...... would be a first thought when someone is introduced to the room the first time, but Underworld basically had only some dirt- or dust-like feeling effect, which did not require an entity object, и disappeared if one runs over it with a broom or a duster. Substantially it was retouching a digital image rather than cleaning, though this wasn’t something Асуна could say bluntly, but Кирито could very well.

Besides, there was another reason why cleaning is easy. 

Surprisingly, Собора...... no, entire Underworld had no toilets at all. Because the inhabitants of this world did not excrete even though they ate. Of course, same went for Асуна и Кирито who came from Real World but had to get accustomed to it; yet still, a thought of *where does all the stuff that allows to feel satiety go* can occur in one’s mind after eating too much.

Кирито, whose Underworld experience was longer than Асуна’s, said "The guys at RATH judged that simulating excretion is not necessary for training AI", but Асуна who had chosen human development science class at the high school in the real world could not agree with that idea. According to Freud's developmental theory, young children have a growing stage called "anal period", where learning confidence и controlling impulses и own sexuality is achieved through training to use a toilet...... that was what she remembered learning.

*Although it is unlikely that eliminating excretion is causing problems for Underworld people's personality, the doubt still remains. Underworld people say "shit" occasionally when cursing, but how do they recognize the meaning of that word? While Я was thinking Я would like to ask someone someday about it, more than a year has passed.*

*Precisely — one year, three months и sixteen days.*

Looking at a parchment calendar on the wall — it seems to have been used at older times, not made by Кирито or Асуна ─ which almost allowed to feel the rushing of time, she heard the door opening и closing in the entrance room.

The black hair of Кирито who came into the living room was still a little wet. It seems that he came back from the big public bath on the ninetieth floor in a hurry. In the past, we used to have the one who was faster to wait for another one at the branch point of the corridor, but after noticing other staff members hesitating to go in as Я was standing there, Я decided to return to our room without waiting.

"Sorry for keeping you waiting."

Said Кирито while approaching her, Асуна unwrapped a towel hanging on his shoulder и responded to greeting.

"You should wipe around your hair properly."

She wrapped his head with a towel и shook it with both hands. *There is no hairdryer in this world, but as you scrub hair with a dry cloth for a certain period of time, the moisture will leave, so after-bath hair care is easier than in the real world.*

While enduring without resistance, Кирито objected to her remark in somewhat childish tone:

"Асуна, it’s because you were faster over there... Я wondered if Я could catch up with you on the corridor..."

"Hey, it’s not me being fast, it’s Кирито-kun having a long bath. Today it was an hour."

"Oh, really?"

As soon as Кирито said so, the evening ten o'clock bell quietly echoed.

"Wow, seriously.... The nine-thirty bell, Я missed it..."

"No way, Я take it you were swimming in the bathtub?"

While asking a question she removed the towel и watched him with a serious look.

"S-such thing Я wouldn’t do... except when Я am alone......."

"Is that so? Here, sit on the sofa. "

She pushed his shoulders down и made him sit at the end of the large sofa in the middle of the living room. Асуна took up the brush she was using until a while ago from the low table и carefully combed the dry black hair. A brush with a silverwork on the ebony handle depicting a dragon that once used to live in the Eastern Empire — not a Western style dragon but an oriental dragon with elongated body — made the hair grow, because it was a magic item that made hair lustrous by simply combing. The two of them were firmly against any luxury, but this brush was given by knight chief Фанатио for the celebration of Вице-Премьер-Мечник's 1st anniversary, и she sincerely appreciated it since then.

Кирито, whose head was entrusted to Асуна’s hands, suddenly said to himself:

"...... Я wonder if Я will be able to complete the clock soon."

"Same here. But you have already been prototyping it for a long time, is it... is it so difficult?"

"Yup. Я need a lot of precision gears to move the hands properly, и gears in this world are in the hoisting device of the castle gate, or in the accelerator of the water turbine, they are good only for applying a big force...... So when Я combined them, it does not work properly as a clock.... The stupid hour bell runs with the perfect precision, but the clock Я made goes crazy и makes no sense..."

" Я guess so."

A nod, и ponderingly:

"... Wait, I’ll ask Фанатио-сан. Certainly, in the past there was a clock in this Собора, right? The Первосвященник-сан made Bercouli-сан’s Меч out of it. So, who made it?"

"Ehm…well, Я guess, it was in the Underworld from the very beginning. The place where this Центрального Собора is located was a small village three hundred years ago, where the staff of RATH brought up the first generation artificial fluctlights. It was just an object they set up in the village. "

"’The first four’......"

While these quiet words reminded of a story she heard from the RATH supervisor Seijiro Kikuoka back at the Ocean Turtle in Real World, Кирито thrusted his right hand into the brushed hair.

"Should the system console on the hundredth floor still function...... I’d call the object data of the clock и could just recreate it."

A bitter smile was an answer to these selfish words.

"Hey, if you can do such a thing, you don’t even have to make a clock as an object, you could just add a time display to the menu window...... to Stacia's window... but before that......."

*── you would be able to stop the Critical Acceleration Phase.*

Асуна left out these last words.

That moment Underworld was operating at a tremendous speed of five million times the reality. It could hardly be believed, but all the long days of one year и three months Асуна has been diving in that world took only about 8 seconds in the Real World. Imagining the huge amount of data that would be exchanged between the STL she was lying in и the fluctlight of her brain vaguely scared her. She feared that the brain could simply burn out someday.

However, if the system console is revived и it becomes possible for them to log out ── Асуна was not sure she could do it without hesitation.

Асуна и Кирито intervened in the governance system of Мира Людей, entire Underworld, which brought enormous и rapid changes. They did not regret it, but the aftermath of the reforms still could be felt и the murder incident happened five days ago was a part of that. The two of them had a responsibility to witness the fate of the world, и should they have to logout without a reason, to look from the outside into Underworld watching the civilization collapsing, — that would be truly regretful.

Perhaps, feeling that there’s something that words can’t express, Кирито unexpectedly raised his hands from behind his head, grabbed Асуна’s body, pulled her forward turning around и sat on his knee.

"Kya~"

She exclaimed, protesting against the stuffed-toy-like treatment.

"Hey, careful!"

But Кирито behind her answered with a tone suggesting a wide grin.

"It's all right, I've supported you with incarnation."

"No problem then! Indeed, what other than superpowers remain to a human at a time of decline...."

"Decline is terrible."

In response, Кирито lightly hugged Асуна from behind.

That moment her body suddenly lose all the energy. Long ago ── seemed like in a previous life, after they just married in the floating castle Incrad, Асуна used to sit the same way on Кирито's knees many times every day, sometimes falling asleep.

A long, long time has passed since that time, but the feeling of being completely protected и that there is nothing to fear when he hugged her this way did not change at all. Holding the dragon-inscribed hair brush in both hands, she leaned against Кирито's chest и closed her eyelids.

*Я want to fall asleep like this, и Кирито will carry me to bed even if Я do, but Я can’t do that. If Я fall asleep, Премьер-Мечник who feels uneasy today will get out of Собора и will depart to search for the three missing гоблинов.*

In the emergency meeting held in the afternoon, it was decided to issue an investigation order to the South Центория administration in the name of Объединённого Совета Мира Людей и the Рыцарь Целостности group, but at that time the 5 pm bell rang, so it was the next morning to take actions. Moreover, since the official who appeared in the inn was probably a fake, even if the investigation in the administration is done, the outcome will most likely be "there was no order issued to transfer гоблинов и there is no such official." Асуна thought it was a bad idea to leave an entire day to the quick-moving killer for granted. Besides, it is unlikely that anyone but Кирито can search the whole Центория и find гоблинов, so it could be a trap inviting Премьер-Мечник just like in Obsidia.

And above all, Асуна was asked by an apprentice knight Ронье to keep an eye on Кирито, и she couldn’t afford failing the trust. *Я must keep my promise to her.*

As soon as she thought of the serious face of Ронье who is worried of Кирито's welfare, the back of her chest hurt.

She knew about her feelings for long time already ── it became apparent even before the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей was inaugurated, she has first noticed that the night she spent with the four of them, including knight Алиса и Мира Людей Defense Army general Solterina during the Войны с Внешним Миром. But Асуна has never talked to Ронье about it since then.

Асуна was painfully conscious that the other one was still 17 years old и suffering from unrewarding feelings. But she did not know what to do with that.

This disconsolance she felt was the same as sometimes touched her in the real world.

Their friends of the real world who were tied to them by true bonds...... Lisbeth, Silica, Shinon, и Leafa. All of them had strong feelings to Кирито, but in front of Асуна they hid it or turned it into a joke. On the contrary, they used every opportunity to cheer и encourage Асуна.

As always, she was happy about it, but felt some pain as well. Thinking of Кирито, who did no effort to make up his mind in such a dangerous situation, only given her this bitter sensation.

But Кирито didn’t change much since the first time she met him in the first level of Incrad. With both hands widely open и accepting everything, never giving up. A person desperately continuing to level-up in the top ranking extremely dangerous labyrinth areas to finally lend a helping hand to fainting Асуна. и despite being an absolutely key player of the party in the following floor boss fight, he embraced hatred и antipathy to former beta tester choosing the road where he remained being called "beater".

This was exactly Кирито Асуна loved.

Therefore, when the two of them with Кирито got trapped in this world, Асуна for just a little, but felt something similar to a relief.

And in the final stage of the Войны с Внешним Миром, her heart could not allow her to leave Кирито alone in this world, so she let only Рыцарь Целостности Алиса to escape to the real world и stayed in Underworld herself. No, after all was over, she understood that the option of logging out alone did not even appeared in her head at that time. So she did not think at all that it is a way to monopolize Кирито, however, after more than one year has passed, she felt no apology would be enough to resolve the ever-growing feeling of guilt before her friends и family whom she would never meet again.

Still ──

The feeling that in this world there is no need to spare his love with Lisbeth, Silica и others was constantly present in one corner of her heart.

Асуна put the brush on the knee, turned around to him и covered Кирито’s hands with both of her own.

The hug became a little stronger.

When they meet again at the "Altar of the End" at the southern end of the Тёмной Территории, Кирито was lying on top of the white stone steps, endless tears flooding from his eyes. Without asking, she knew that those were tears for the people whom they could not meet anymore.

A long time has passed from that time, but she rarely mentioned to Кирито any memories of the real world, their friends и families whom they would now bid eternal farewells. This, as well as reasons of this world, where there were too many things to think about, were why Асуна has still not managed to organize her emotions. Perhaps, for Кирито it was the same.

*That's why Я want to face Ронье seriously. Rather than repeating the same mistakes as in the real world, Я need to think about what Я can do for her и what should Я do. Always think this way ──*

"...... It is about time to sleep."

When Асуна whispered, Кирито responded "Right", just behind her right ear.

She tried to get off the knees, but the right hand of Кирито moved around her back just before that, и he lifted her up holding from both sides.

"Oh, ... wai...."

As soon as he unexpectedly moved her, the dragon-decorated hair brush that Асуна had on her body, rolled down. However, it stops silently around 50 centimeters above the floor, slid sideways и landed on the low table. Кирито caught it with the "hand of mind".

At that time, Асуна has practiced this supernatural ability that only Кирито и the senior knights could use, but her limit was to move a small Shear copper coin. However, when one can move things around so freely, the life seemed to be decreasing и she was a little bit afraid of that. But still, it surely could be of use for occasional housekeeping tasks like dishes и own rooms cleaning.

"...... it is not surprising anymore."

She glanced at Кирито sullenly, a mischievous smile returning to the face.

"Я made an impossible today with the Past Reflection, it's about that, is not it?"

"It’s all about that."

While answering so, Кирито crossed the wide living room with a relaxed walk и opened the door of the bedroom again using the incarnation.

In the middle of a room nearly double of Асуна's own room in the real world, there was a bed one size larger than a king size. When she saw it for the first time, she complained to Фанатио, "That’s too luxurious ", who told her that this bed was brought in at the time when the 30th floor of the Собора was built, и it could not be taken out of the room unless it is already broken ─ a smart explanation to which there was nothing she could say. Besides, Асуна, who was somewhat fond of natural wooden furniture, could not deny that the massive black walnut solid headboard was keeping her glances.

According to Higa Takeru from RATH, Underworld used terrain и objects generated by the "The Seed" program transformed into a super-high-resolution "mnemonic-visual" data format. и since The Seed was a shrunk version of the Cardinal system that had run SAO, in a way it could be said that walnut trees growing in Underworld were of the same electronic genus as those of Incrad.

Асуна laid down on the right side of the bed, Кирито walked around the footboard и seated on the left side. His line of sight turned to light element lanterns shining softly in two places on the wall, и elements disappeared controlled by his incarnation. When the artificial light went out, the moonlight flowing in through the large window on the left side of Асуна shaded the room lightly blue.

Кирито then pulled up the quilt folded down at feet и covered Асуна tightly up till the neck. As if to make a bed for small child, he lightly tapped it from the top to the futon, и then also lied down.

"..... even when Я fall asleep, have no hope of sneaking out."

Асуна whispered, feeling a calming drowsiness. From the right side, came a sigh of bitter smile.

"Я won’t, indeed, in this large Центория there’s no way to locate those гоблинов..."

![Image](/Translate/Img/p137.jpg)

"Fine, they will be found safely. Even for the criminals, to have another incident, preparations are necessary.... should be..."

Her right hand moved towards Кирито, resisting the drowsiness the body suddenly sunk into. Immediately a large и warm left hand found Асуна's hand и gently grasped.

Recently, when just two of them remained alone, she let herself to behave in a more childish way. It happened unintentionally и for no specific reason.

Perhaps the reason might be that the mental age of the two of them was reversed.

Асуна's birthday was September 30, 2007. Кирито's birthday was October 7, 2008. Асуна was one year older all the time, but Кирито spent two years eight months of life in Underworld where time has been accelerated before Асуна dived. However, he was in unconscious state for half a year of which he did not have memory. Therefore, even if six months are deducted, Кирито is now one year и two months older than her by mental age.

There were few opportunities to be conscious of it in an everyday life, but in small gestures и words they exchanged when left alone, she didn’t feel anymore that immaturity Кирито of the Incrad era sometimes had. The accumulation of that sensation might make Асуна childish.

Come to think of it, when she came across Кирито at SAO, he was high school student of only 14 years old. и Асуна was also a high school third grader just before taking the exam. The two who decided to unite in the course of action, communicated in a childish way with each other.

Recollecting memories of that period that seem to be so long time ago, Асуна fell into the deep и soft sleep.

Despite the actual size of more than 80 m<sup>2</sup>, it is significantly larger than the “default” size for a housing 2 in Japan (about twice as larger). For example, according to Vol.18 Epilogue 6, Higa Takeru’s apartment in Higashgotanda had 8-татами main room, which corresponds to a western-style bedroom size.
