How many minutes — how many hours have actually passed?

There was no way to know the current time in a dungeon which had not a single window и no Центория time bells could be heard either. Премьер-Мечник used to say "I'd like to finish the wearable watch as soon as possible", but though he tested a lot of prototypes with head engineer Sadore, it seemed to be far from complete.

Every time Ронье heard that words, she secretly thought, *since the time bell tells the exact time, why would it be necessary to carry bulky equipment......* but after getting in such a situation she had no choice but to change her mind.

Also, the melody that the thousands of bells all over Мира Людей play was a hymn called "Under the light of Solus". It was a beautiful piece of music, but knowing that the history of the Церковь Аксиом is covered with countless lies, listening to a hymn it’s quite difficult to sincerely praise gods as it was before.

The art in Мира Людей such as music, painting, sculpture и poetry were still severely restricted by the Индекс Табу. It was only those who were given the sacred task of an artist could advance the artistic path, и they must also undergo a judgment by the Imperial Government before the work is announced. If the content even slightly denies the genesis myth or Церковь Аксиом, or is excessively entertaining, it gets banned.

Премьер-Мечник wanted to immediately deprecate the screening system, but the idea was fought back by the Union Council — specifically, as expected, by Рыцарь Целостности Nergius — so it has not come true yet. It was still a little difficult question for Ронье, but she thought that it will be good when time comes for people to sing songs, paint pictures и write stories freely without being bound by any screening.

*In order to see such an era, we must survive и escape from here.*

Almost at the same time as Ронье reconsolidated her resolve again, the quiet sound echoed:

"Ugh, it's useless......."

Тейза, who was attempting the "Pick of Mind " in front of the iron gate, flopped to the floor.

"Кирито-сенпай would probably have opened in no time..."

Although it was a crisis situation, unexpectedly Ронье bitterly smiled to her best friend's words.

"Hey, you cannot do the same thing as the Сенпай so easily"

"That's right, but... how about you?"

She returned a silent denial to that whispered question.

While her best friend was trying the Pick of Mind, Ронье was looking over the dungeon walls, but as expected no hidden door or a destructible location could be found. It was impossible to quietly extract the Северной Империи granite stone forming a wall without even a 1 mil gap, even with the power of apprentice knights, и if you try to forcibly destroy walls or grating the sound would be transmitted to the mansion above.

Тейза who finally raised her body, sat hugging her knees и said as if to herself:

"Шимосаки, you all right there?"

It was the fourth time she sighed out the same question. Still, Ронье kneeled next to her best friend и answered gently stroking her back:

"Sure he’s okay. We’ll meet soon."

While rubbing the back of Тейза who was silently nodding, Ронье also pondered about Цукигаке inside her mind.

Between the mansion и the Центория Северной Gate, there were some hills, but all-in-all there were just flat plains alternating with former direct jurisdiction farms. Ронье was not familiar with the state of private territories but she though there couldn’t be any animals capable of fighting small dragons there. She could not say there was absolutely no possibility of encountering an unexpected danger, so Ронье only hoped for Цукигаке to arrive safely.

*── Gods-сама.*

Even though she knew that neither the gods’ world in the sky nor the gods themselves living there existed, Ронье devoted her heartfelt prayer.

*── Please, please take care of Цукигаке и Шимосаки.*

She could not hear a voice answering.

Instead, she heard the sound of heavy rocks rubbing against each other.

The thick stone wall illuminated by the lanterns was slowly rising up on the left side of the passage. Ронье и Тейза winced, abruptly stood up и went closer to the back wall. In the adjacent cell, the mountain гоблинов let out screams in multiple voices.

The one who slowly, as if seeping out of the darkness behind the completely raised door, appeared was a man in a black robe called Зеппос by Император Крюгер.

The man walked through the aisle while chinking the key ring hanging on his right и stopped in front of the cell with Ронье и the other one. He peered inside with a gentle movement, his gaze from behind the hood glided over the two of them, then without saying a word he returned to the previous movement. Went forward several steps и stopped again in front of the next cell.

Is it just a patrol, thought Ронье и carefully got closer to the grate to watch the man. The man then inserted into one in the bunch of keys into the lock.

**Ga-chin**, echoed the cold sound, и the гоблинов raised frightened voices again. The man who opened the door without hesitation declared with a strangely distorted voice:

"Animals, all three of you, get out of the cell."

The гоблинов squeaking immediately seized. A quiet whispering voice asked:

"You us...... let out?"

After about three seconds, Зеппос answered "yes".

Ронье felt it was a lie. The silence was unnatural, и he could not just release the гоблинов whom they abducted from the inn in Южной Центория with a great deal of trouble.

But the mountain гоблинов came out of the cell without showing suspicion of doubting the words of the man.

"Proceed to that door."

— said Зеппос said, pointing at the hidden door on the left side, not the right side where there was an exit to the surface. The three of them quietly obeyed и began walking. As if blocking the escape route, Зеппос followed behind.

The moment when the man was passing in front of a grate, Ронье could not stand it и said:

"What are you going to do with those people?"

The гоблинов stopped и turned their looks at Ронье; they seemed to fully believe the promise to release, so looked disappointed и sorry. Behind them, Зеппос blasted with a squeaking laughter:

"Ку-ku...... ‘people’, you say?"

"What's funny?"

It was Тейза who asked it. Зеппос twisted his body again и after looking into the prison replied with a smile.

"Гоблины останутся гоблинами покуда их Жизнь не истечёт, no matter how much the world changes."

Ронье thought she already heard these words somewhere. But before the memory came out to her, Зеппос came back to senses и ordered the three ahead:

"Now move, go up the stairs и I'll let you out."

The figures of Зеппос и the гоблинов who resorted to move forward timidly dissolved in the darkness behind the secret door. The sound of four footsteps moved up the stone stairs, и also disappeared. Finally, a ‘**Gii!**’ sound shrieked, и the silence returned to the dungeon.

"............ really, they’ve got no reason to release them, huh......"

— whispered Тейза, и Ронье had no choice but to nod.

"Perhaps... something is ready. Я do not know what it is.... but I'm sure it is somehow related to гоблинов-сан."

When she responded in a whispering, Тейза touched her lips for a moment и said with tighter expression.

"Кирито-сенпай said that the kidnappers will commit another murder in Центория и that he will frame the abducted гоблинов-сан again. If so...... innocent people will be killed in Центория again."

"…………Yup……"

While nodding again, Ронье thought hard.

If her friend’s guess is right, whom the kidnappers — who are Император Крюгер и Зеппос, are going to kill?

Кирито was also saying this as well.

If the culprit was able to violate the Индекс Табу и kill Язен-сан because he was a former private territory dweller, other former serfs could be killed in the same way.

Премьер-Мечник thought so because he could hear the voice of the murderer in Асуна's "past reflection art". The words of the culprit just before killing the old Язен.

*── Крепостные частных владений остаются собственностью этих владений, покуда их Жизнь не истечёт, так что если тебя это не устраивает, то прямо здесь и сейчас прими же смерть дарованную.*

"…………Ah!"

— exclaimed Ронье as Зеппос’ voice heard just a few minutes ago revived in her mind.

*── Гоблины останутся гоблинами покуда их Жизнь не истечёт.*

Just because the subject is different, exactly the same phrase.

That's it. Too weak for the evidence, purely circumstantial. But Ронье believed her intuition was correct.

"...... That guy called Зеппос is the culprit who killed Язен-сан in the inn."

As she said so in a shivering voice, Тейза who also felt the same, nodded deeply with a tight expression.

"Yeah.... Я feel that too, don’t know how far he can break the Индекс Табу, but he’ll definitely try to use гоблинов-сан to cause a more serious incident than the one of Язен-сан's case. We must stop him as soon as possible."

"Eeeh..."

While muttering, Ронье gazed at the darkness behind the secret door on the other side of the grid.

*Я do not know how much exactly time has elapsed, but if everything went well, about now Цукигаке would be arriving at the Северной gate of Центория. But, of course she<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup> cannot speak in human language. A gatekeeper guard will notice that Цукигаке is a little dragon, will send a message to the Собора, a report will reach someone like Кирито or Асуна, or an Рыцарь Целостности, и it will take tens of minutes for help to come to this location ──*

Moreover, the carriage which Ронье и Тейза rode on was parked on the Восточной bank of the lake. It would be impossible for Премьер-Мечник or anyone else to guess that two of them are held in a dungeon of a mansion in the forest on its Западной bank. The only hope was to expect that Цукигаке would guide the rescue team, but it also takes time, и overall it was clear that it will take как минимум an hour to get help no matter how optimistic estimations are.

*It would be too naïve to think that until then nothing will happen to the гоблинов that were taken to the upper floor. If we do not act now, it will be too late.*

But it is impossible to quietly destroy this sturdy grid. In the first place it is unknown whether it can be broken by the power of the two people, but even if we just try it, a loud sound will reach the mansion above и the Император would notice. If so, Я do not know what hostage Шимосаки will face.

Unable to come up with an answer, Ронье closed her eyes.

*Я felt this feeling just a week ago. In the Obsidia Castle of Тёмной Территории which we visited with Кирито, Lisetta, the only daughter of Isukan General Commander и Ambassador Шейта, was kidnapped и kidnappers requested Кирито's public execution. If it’s not done by sunset, Lisetta's Life would have been zeroed.*

As the time limit was approaching, Ронье lost her serenity и firmly insisted in front of Кирито. If Кирито chooses to be executed, she will also be executed with him.

To that words of Ронье, Кирито said:

*── Я will not give up. I’ll certainly save Lisetta. и then, we’ll return to Собора together with Ронье. To the place of our home...*

*Yes, you must not give up. Do not just wait for everything to resolve with Цукигаке alone, but think hard what you can do now. There must be a way that will not result in sacrificing both гоблинов и Шимосаки.*

"... Тейза"

The same moment Ронье whispered, her best friend said as well:

"Let's break the iron grid."

"Eh!…"

What was considered the last resort has suddenly been proposed first и foremost, и Ронье involuntarily protested:

"B-but, if the sounds are heard above, Шимосаки......."

Then Тейза interrupted her with a gesture of understanding, и then glanced at the dungeon ceiling.

"...... Я guess there are not so many people in this mansion. Maybe, only two: the Император и Зеппос...... If so, the Император won’t bother taking the risk of countering us."

Indeed, at that time Император Крюгер continued to attract their attention as a decoy until Зеппос creeped out from behind of Ронье и caught Шимосаки. If there were others or minions around, he would have made a decoy of them.

"Well... it seems so..."

"If there are only two of them, Я think we can secure Шимосаки if we attack suddenly. Fortunately, our Мечs should be left just behind the secret door."

"............"

Ронье stared at the darkness behind the secret door.

The drawn Мечs that the two of them dropped on the floor were kicked to the other side of the door by Император Крюгер, but there was no evidence that they were taken from there to the upper floors. Should they be able to escape from the cell, there was a high chance of retrieving the Мечs back right away.

*If Я have my beloved Меч, even if that one was a genuine Император Крюгер, Я do not feel like losing. But, again, Я am worried about Шимосаки. Even if there are only two enemies there, it is necessary to как минимум know where he is kept in the mansion in advance to rescue him with surprise attack as Тейза suggested.*

"Тейза."

While standing in front of her best friend, Ронье lifted her hands:

"Lend a hand."

"Eh……?"

She firmly grasped the hands the other one raised with bewildered expression on the face.

"Trying to open locks with incarnation is unreasonable, it perhaps we can try incarnational sensivity."

When the Ронье said this, Тейза opened her autumn leaves colored eyes wide.

The training of the incarnational power emphasized the "ability to perceive" as much as the "ability to influence". The training of "Tanza mind wiping", which the two of them were struggling with, was all about sitting on the training ground, closing the eyes, blanking the mind, и attempting to broaden the perceptual power by the incarnation.

Кирито, who had the greatest power of incarnation in Мира Людей, said "If your opponent is a dragon, you can sense it even if you are 10 kilolu away", but Ронье и herself did not even sense humans within the same room. и now it was about locating a small dragon through a thick stone ceiling. Although it seemed reckless, there was no other way to find Шимосаки's location.

Тейза, who thought this way, wanted to say something for a moment, but quickly squeezed lips. Grasped Ронье’s hands и meditated.

Ронье closed her eyes too и quietly inhaled the cold dungeon air. Тейза in front of her also breathed in. Held it for precisely 1 second, then slowly exhaled.

Although the incarnational power was an individual strength, it can be maxed out by the state of "the spiritual unity" which is achievable by breathing synchronously with someone while holding their hands. With that being quite an advanced technique, even together with such a close friend as Тейза they have only succeeded in it several times in the past. However, the power of one person would probably be not enough to pierce the ceiling with incarnational sensing.

The breathing of two deepened with every inhale. The sensation of touching each other’s skin melted, the distance dissolved. The boundary between themselves и the outside world gradually faded little by little, as the perception range spread.

*Я can feel three are present almost directly above the dungeon. It seems they are lying side by side. This would be three mountain гоблинов.*

*Two presences somewhere away. They are felt so cold as it cannot be thought of a living human being, that must be Император Крюгер и Зеппос.*

And there was a small but very warm presence in the corner of the same room. As soon as they perceived it, Тейза’s breathing became slightly disrupted. For a moment, the overlapping incarnational fields fluctuated but quickly regained stability. They sensed Шимосаки's feelings of anxiety и tension, but there was no sign of a major injury.

The sensing range extended further. They can vaguely perceive the layout of the mansion. It was only referred to as an imperial villa, however on both the first floor и the second floor there were many rooms; luckily, all the other halls except the one with five people и Шимосаки seemed to be unmanned.

*If we climb the stairs behind the secret door out of the dungeon, we’d get to a room that seems to be a storage on the first floor of the mansion, from there the door of the hall is just 5 meters away via the corridor. If two of us run with full power, it’s fifteen — no, just ten seconds.*

Ронье и Тейза lifted the eyelids at the same time и stared each other's eyes.

No words were needed. They let go of hands и turned to the iron grid.

It would be difficult to destroy it with bare hands, but the Мечs’ sheaths, which were quite robust too, were left on the waists of both. Priorities of those did not reach the Мечs’ ones, but they should endure a single slash.

"... Hey, do you remember? The way Юдзио-сенпай и Кирито-сенпай escaped from Собора's dungeon."

— Тейза suddenly whispered, Ронье blinked to that.

"Of course. They cut the divine iron chains, и using them broke the grid."

"When Я heard that story, Я thought, man our Сенпайs are tough, but... no way Я could ever imagine we would do the same thing."

"Me too."

A momentary smile wiped out, и Ронье with clasp removed the empty sheath from the Меч belt with her left hand. Pased it to the right hand и raised it vertically. Тейза next to her made perfectly identical movement.

*Я do not know what the Император и Зеппос are doing to the гоблинов in the hall above. However, if we take the next step, we cannot lose even a second.*

*…………sorry.*

After apologizing to the sheath in my mind, Ронье sharply breathed in.

*One cannot use secret moves with a sheath, but Я will just hit as much as Я can.*

"Haaah!"

"Yaaaa!"

With the increasingly loud screams, two people sharply swung down empty sheaths performing Norkia style secret move "Lightning slash", also known as Incrad style secret move "Vertical".

It was probably an illusion that the sheath made of wood и leather felt wrapped in faint blue light. The two sheaths crashed into the steel grid и crumbled down to pieces with a tremendous pulsing sound.

Immediately afterwards, a grating of 2 mel height и 4 mel width split in two pieces, blew out of the framing и blasted against the other side of the aisle. Again, the thunderous roaring shook the whole dungeon.

*── Go!*

— though Тейза without saying a word, и to this thought:

*── Within ten seconds!*

— same way silently answered her Ронье jumping into the aisle.

Rushing into a secret door that was left open, they saw a small storage-like room. There were some leather bands looking like restraints on the right wall и strange shaped cutlery и glass containers on the left wall lined up. It was obvious how it was used, but pushing that out of heads, they searched around the floor relying on the weak light flowing in from behind.

Ронье's Меч of the Moonlight и Тейза's Меч were carelessly thrown somewhere in the corner of the warehouse. Ронье who found the Меч first picked up her beloved Меч with her right hand и Тейза's Меч with her left hand и threw it to her partner.

Three seconds have elapsed so far.

A stone stairway extended up in the front wall. Grasping the naked Меч, they rushed up skipping five steps at a time.

The door at the end of the stairs was kicked open, revealing a storage room, bigger than the previous one. A large window, despite facing Северной, let in plenty of sunset-colored outside light, и it was much brighter than in a small basement room. The myriad of display shelves и armor stands around the floor и walls were all empty. When this villa was sealed off, the treasures must have been removed. The door that Ронье kicked off was disguised as a large shelf, и it would be difficult to find if one doesn’t know what to look for.

Seven seconds passed.

There were real doors: one on the Западной и one on the Южной walls. Since the structure of the mansion was roughly sensed with incarnational sensing, they rushed over to the Западной door without hesitation и kicked it open again.

The door was blown away from the destroyed hinges и crashed against the opposite wall, but they ran ahead without worrying about it. Behind it there was a gorgeous hallway lasting long in both directions. The red wallpaper depicted a lily и a hawk.

The door of this corridor they we aiming at was just 15 mels to the left.

Eight seconds. Nine seconds.

Mustering together all the knight’s leg strength, Ронье, who had run through the corridor in two seconds, turned to the huge two-piece door и burst a kick in the center. Although it did not blow off as she, frankly speaking, expected, both pieces of the door opened wide with the momentum just barely insufficient to break them и revealed the interior scenery.

Ten seconds.

A vast room that would occupy about one-third of the first-floor area was dark. All the Южной side windows were covered with black curtains. It was not perfect darkness though because ten or so candles were lit in the center.

Candles were arranged in a circle about 2 mels in diameter, with three гоблинов lying in it. A black figure standing just outside the circle seemed to be casting some sort of an incantation. *Although we had no doubt that nothing good was happening here, now that’s surely ──*

Wide open Ронье’s eyes noticed a large jute bag rolled in the corner of the left side of the hall и a second black figure about to run there.

The shadow's identity would be Зеппос. There was no need to guess what was inside the bag.

*── Тейза!*

While calling her in her mind, Ронье stuck the left hand forward.

At the same time Тейза swapped Меч и lifted the right hand that crossed Ронье's one.

"**System Call! Generate Thermal Element!**"

Ронье continued the sacred art Тейза began casting:

"**Form Element! Arrow Shape!**"

The five thermal elements Тейза produced instantaneously changed to five arrows according to Ронье's incantation. It was an advanced technique which allowed to shorten the activation time in half by sharing between casters the chant statements of element generation и forming, "tuned chant". To use it, Тейза и Ронье had to train together for a long time, beginning even before they became apprentice knights ── way before that, actually, since the time they were junior students. But now both "spiritual unity" и "tuned chant" techniques which even senior knights could succeed in with low probability, were available to them.

The two of them, after completing the element generation и formation in just two seconds shouted the last word aloud synchronously:

![Image](/Translate/Img/p269.jpg)

"**Discharge!!**" x2

The five glowing lines tore up the darkness.

The shadow in the black robe avoided the flaming arrows swooping ahead with a hum, by jumping backwards with a superhuman move. Arrows were crashing into the wall one after another, causing small explosions.

"Go, Тейза!"

— shouted Ронье while controlling the remaining two arrows.

Тейза removed her hand и rushed to the jute bag. In order to push the black robe — Зеппос further away, Ронье bent the flame arrows trajectory to follow him.

The fourth one also missed. But the fifth arrow hit the robe which flared up.

Зеппос silently dismissed of the robe и retreated further. At the same time, Тейза reached the jute bag и cut off the drawstring tightly tying its neck with the Меч in her left hand.

"Шимосаки!"

— she shouted with a breaking voice, while inserting the left hand<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> into the bag.

The young dragon she pulled out и embraced had some plume fallen out where the light blue feathers received a rough handling, but chirped a limp и quiet "Ку-ру-ру......" squeezing into the owner’s chest.

Feeling how the relief due to Шимосаки's safety is being overcome with anxiety for Цукигаке which has not returned yet, Ронье shouted loudly:

"Тейза, take Шимосаки to the safe place outside! Leave this here to me!"

"But...!!"

She resolutely insisted to her partner who was about to shake her head:

"Go!"

In order to help the гоблинов who seemed to lose consciousness, it is inevitable to fight with Зеппос и the Император who continued to chant something unclear. It was impossible to fight while holding Шимосаки, и they would never be able to regain him if he’s taken away again.

"...... Got it, I’ll be right back!"

Having shouted this, Тейза swung the Меч around herself. The nearby curtain was cut off и the glass window behind it crumbled with a loud noise.

Cutting through the darkness, the square of reddened sunset light burst into the hall. As if fearing the light of Solus, Зеппос who lost black robe retreated further.

What the man was wearing under robe was something very much resembling a physical restraint covering the whole body. A number of leather bands fixed together with countless rivets were wound tightly around the stick-thin limbs и body, и it wasn’t clear whether it was a protective gear or a kind of punishment.

And the skin looking through the gaps in the leather belts was also of a strange color. One couldn’t be certain watching it just under the reflected light of the setting Solus, but it’s bluish-gray color couldn’t be thought of as a human one.

*Я think Я saw this somewhere already......* While Ронье thought so, Тейза holding Шимосаки jumped through the broken window и escaped to the front yard. In order to hide Шимосаки in a safe place, she has run to the forest surrounding the mansion.

*It's two to one until the she comes back. Not that it’s impossible, but Я am concerned about the extraordinarily long art that Император Крюгер continues to cast over гоблинов lying on the floor.*

She listened carefully to the weird voice, but could not understand the meaning of a single word of a chant. However, once the operation is completed, it is certainly that some bad things will happen.

Ронье tried to generate new thermal elements in order to interrupt the Император's incantation while pointing the tip of the Меч of the Moonlight straight to Зеппос.

But just before that, Зеппос, who was retreating to the Южной window covered by the curtain, pulled out two daggers with almost no sound from the sheaths attached to the leather bands on both legs. The one in the right hand was slightly larger, but the blade in the left hand was covered with some green liquid.

*The blade in the left hand, same poison knife he pointed to Шимосаки back there in the dungeon.  
And perhaps the one in the right hand is the knife used to take old Язен's life.*

While going around the candle circle in the center of the hall, Зеппос was getting closer и closer. The light of sunset flowing through the only window that has lost a curtain illuminated in red his face that was hidden under the hood until now.

There was no single hair on the man's head. The elongated face was also blue-and-black like the body, the bizarre pupils of small eyes glowed bright. This face didn’t remind her of anyone.

"...... you got out of the prison quite a bit sooner than expected, you know?"

— Зеппос whispered, with indifferent expression.

"Than what expected....... So... was it on purpose that you left the secret door open?"

The all skin-and-bones man produced a thin smile to Ронье's question:

"Oh, certainly. Would you think that Император Норлангарт house's great chamberlain, being me, can allow for something as bad as forgetting to close the door?"

"Great chamberlain......!?<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>"

As Ронье opened both eyes wide, Зеппос deepened his little smile.

Since she has never met a person who is Император Норлангарт house's great chamberlain before or after the battle for the Imperial Palace, it was no wonder she didn’t recognize his face. But Ронье knew what happened to him. She surely heard what Мира Людей Defense Army General Selrut had reported at the meeting after the chaos was suppressed.

"The Император house's great chamberlain... should be dead. He refused to break up with the leaders of great aristocrats и was eliminated by the Мира Людей army, that’s what Я heard. "

"That was my duty, my pleasure. If it is for his Император's Majesty, Я will die again и again, as often as Я can."

Crossing his hands holding knives over his chest while saying so, Зеппос quickly glanced at the black robe man standing in the center of the hall.

Specifically, at the supposedly dead Император Крюгер Норлангарт who continued to chant the mysterious incantation. Moreover, unlike Зеппос, Ронье herself took the Император's life. Her palms still remembered the feeling when the Меч she grasped deeply pierced the right side of the Император's chest.

*If they are not impersonators, it means that according to the words of Зеппос they have recovered from death. However, the resurrection of dead is something impossible neither for Кирито who has the greatest mind power of Мира Людей, nor for Асуна who possesses the power of the goddess Stacia, nor for Ayuha Furia, the Sacred Art department head — nor for the half-god who continued to rule Мира Людей for over 300 years, Первосвященник Администратор. Я cannot believe that these two were truly resurrected. Something evil...... some unimaginably wicked trick should be used for that*, Ронье thought.

Perhaps, reading these thoughts from the expression of Ронье, Зеппос returned to the story и opened the crossed arms.

"To keep the doors of the dungeons open was, of course, to lure you here. Because thou is a perfect match for гоблинов combat training, without the need to pass that hidden passage....... "

"Combat training...... needn’t to pass...?"

While repeating after him with a hoarse voice, Ронье gazed at the гоблинов lying in the circle of candles. No matter how they looked, they were even smaller than Ронье, not mentioning tall Зеппос и the Император, of course. *To begin with, what was the problem that made them to took you out of the dungeon?*

That was something she couldn’t understand, but one thing was certain — that it was necessary to stop the incantation as soon as possible. To do that, she first had to eliminate Зеппос.

"...... Enough of this wasteful talk. If you are resurrected from death, Я will just drive you back to the deeps of the ground!"

— Ронье stated resolutely и held up her left hand.

*Зеппос has blades in both hands. He cannot use Sacred Arts this way. I’ll pause for an art, then will immediately shorten the distance и slay him.*

"**System Call! Generate Thermal Element!**"

Just like minutes ago, when she let Тейза to continue the incantation after the elements generation to maximize speed, she created 5 thermal elements. At the same time, Зеппос kicked of the floor и jumped over with two blades in hands. He seemed to think that since it was not a "tuned chant", the early attack would work, but that was a trap Ронье set up.

Ронье jumped back и shouted, leaving elements in the place of generation:

"**Discharge!!**"

Five thermal elements were discharged at once и exploded with tremendous roar.

It is necessary to process the element in order to hit the target of no fixed position by an attack technique. "**Arrow shape**" gives priority to linear penetrating power, "**bird shape**" gives an ability to pursuit, и there are many other processing formulae, but if enemies themselves come to the location of an element, they all are unnecessary. Just release it as it is at the moment of contact.

As Ронье planned, Зеппос was caught in the explosion. His leather bands which she couldn’t even call an armor won’t be able to negate the damage. Although thermal elements blast is a basic attack technique, the five elements blasted together have the power enough to completely erase the Life of even young и tough soldier.

*And even if you survive, you cannot move right away. So, I’ll slay you ── there!*

"Waaaa!!!"

With a high shout, she crushed the Меч of the Moonlight down towards the center of the black smoke cloud remaining in the air.

**Ga-ki~i~i~n**! The piercing metal sound echoed, и the Меч stopped with the impact which was passed from the wrist to the right shoulder.

"............!?"

In front of astonished Ронье, Зеппос appeared from the dissolving smoke.

Most of the leather bands were burned black, и some parts torn apart. The most damaged was in the right chest, ragged leather bands were loosely dangling, и beneath the skin had a hollow enough to fir two fists. But that was it. Not a single drop of blood was flowing, и his right hand holding a large knife over his head firmly received Ронье’s Меч.

*Impossible. He is standing despite the body is dented to the degree that the lungs и heart should collapse.* The full-body blow with the Меч of the Moonlight, which had the priority of the Divine Object class, delivered by Ронье, who despite being an apprentice, belonged to Рыцари Целостности, was stopped by one hand of a great chamberlain who wasn’t even a guard.

Standing close to her, Зеппос burst into laughter.

A small knife in his left hand, wet of poisonous green, was quickly protruding, и Ронье tried to avoid it by jumping backwards.

But she did not make it. The knife slid like a green snake through the air, reaching to her chest. The edge of the fluttering cloak is cut away without a sound ──

**Zag**!

— A damp sound reached Ронье's ears.

However, it was a piece of silver metal flying from behind — probably a stake generated from metallic element — that made the sound when it deeply pierced Зеппос' belly.

"Ронье!"

— Тейза shouted и jumped through the cracked window, grasping the naked standard Меч:

"Get away from her!"

Following her friend’s voice, she retreated a step away from the poisoned knife which stopped just a few millis away from the solar plexus. Зеппос wiped out his smile и tried to catch up, but Тейза shouted again:

"**Discharge!!**"

Зеппос stared at the pointed tip of the second stake that flew with a humming sound, hit his back и protruded from the center of his chest. Blackened blood was splattered from the man's mouth.

*This time, he’s dead. There are no people living with the heart pierced with a 3 cen thick stake.*

Confident of that, Ронье stepped on the floor with both feet и brandished the Меч to deliver the final slash.

"No, he still can move!"

Had Тейза not shout so, she might have been beheaded by a large knife Зеппос swept sideways at a horribly rapid speed.

"Wha............"

Astonished, Ронье bent her upper body to the limit. A blunt silver blade flew so close that her neck felt the pressure of the air it created.

Зеппос who swayed the knife also did not seem to be dead, but he was not intact either; he stopped following her и retreated with uneven steps. Stopped near the center of the hall и spread the two knives as if trying to protect the circle of candles.

Тейза ran through the hall’s space to a place by the side of Ронье, shouting with the Меч directed to Зеппос.

"Ронье, he is not a human!"

"Eh... what do you mean...?"

As Ронье dashed a confused gaze back и forth to the broken window where she jumped in, Тейза added:

"I’ve found a heap of jute bags in the deeps of the forest. Inside them, was pure soil...... clay, stinking badly."

"Clay……?"

At the moment when she heard that word, Ронье's mind suddenly flashed.

Зеппос' gray skin. Even if he gets caught in the thermal elements explosion, it is just a hollow appearing in the body. Darkish blood.

Ронье saw a body with a similar texture at Obsidia Castle in Тёмной Территории. Not human. A huge monster suddenly appearing in the treasury store ──

"............ Minion!"

Тейза nodded deeply to Ронье’s panting voice, и Зеппос twisted his lips wet with black blood.

Minion. An artificial creature that could only be produced by Тёмной Территории Dark Arts Guild Masters. Although it accepts only simple instructions, it has enormous Life suitable for a large body и has high resistance to heat и cold. If Зеппос is a Minion made of clay rather than man, that could very well explain that the body only dented even though it was hit directly by five thermal elements explosion.

But that possibility suggested a new mystery.

"Minion...... It is a monster that cannot even speak. But he ...!"

When Ронье shouted that, Зеппос, with its belly и chest penetrated by the steel-element stake, said with thunderous voice:

"...... It was not just you guys from Церковь Аксиом who were doing research on Sacred Art....... His Majesty Крюгер...... no, those of the oldest и most precious bloodline of the four imperial houses have been running a countless study in order to complete a certain Art since hundreds of years ago..."

"The Four Императорs...... collaborated!?"

— this time Тейза exclaimed in surprise.

Ронье was appalled the same way. For Ронье born in the lower aristocratic house of the Норлангарт Северной Империи, the other three Империиs for the long time weren’t anything more than the far-away countries. It was only after she joined the Войны с Внешним Миром when she learned the hard way that the Timeless Wall, which she thought was the end of the world, could be jumped over with a minimal effort, и that there is a vast world spreading outside of Мира Людей.

*But Зеппос said that the Императорs of the four Империиs had been doing research on Sacred Art for hundreds of years since a long time ago. Although it was a shocking story, it was not impossible come to think of it. If there were bills of passage even under the reign of the Первосвященник, it was possible to go и cross the Timeless Wall, и the four castles towering around the Собора were not farther away from each other than one kilolu by the sky. Even if it is unreasonable for the Император himself to go back и forth, it is fully possible for someone else. For example, for a person in a position of a great chamberlain ──*

"What is that art!?"

Зеппос returned an unusual chuckle to Тейза’s request:

"Gy, gy-gy-gy...... What a foolish girl you are that you have not understand it yet. I’ll tell you...... it is a technique to acquire the privilege of gods monopolized by the Первосвященник, ‘Eternal life’.... "

"Eternal……"

"…life, is it!?"

Struck by the new shock, Ронье и Тейза just stood stock still.

Meanwhile, Зеппос’ body quivered with some sort of cheerful vibe, as he grabbed his narrow head with both hands holding knives:

"Gy-gy-gy....... We used all sorts of experiments to stop the natural decline of Life: all kinds of art, media from elixirs to even toxic poison sometimes. That dungeon where you were confined before. Lot of serfs died there dedicating their lives for this sublime purpose..."

A horrible monologue, followed by an annoying laughter.

Ронье frowned feeling deep grudge, и hatred, и jealousy in his voice и tenacious look.

*The one who became a great chamberlain of the imperial house, should have had a position и power comparable to the senior nobility. Such a person, what could he be jealous of the two who are barely apprentice knights?......* this thought really took her aback.

But it was not Тейза и Ронье as individuals that Зеппос was jealous of. It was the very existence of Рыцари Целостности. Immortals whose Life was frozen, living for eternity ──

For the Император и senior nobility who were given the highest power a human may have и used to live a life full of luxury, there perhaps was nobody they could be more jealous of than the Первосвященник и the Рыцари Целостности overlooking the Мира Людей from the top of white tower far higher than the Imperial Palace while enjoying their eternal lives, which they could never gain no matter how much desired. Moreover, because of the Индекс Табу which forces submission to the Церковь Аксиом, even Император was not allowed to reveal antipathy.

However, Рыцари Целостности suffered the Рыцари Целостности’ troubles. Ронье knew that since entering Собора.

Those whose Lives have been frozen must go through repeated separation from the others who do not live indefinitely. For example, knights’ head Фанатио. She is forever young person who have lived for more than two hundred years, but Berchie, her son, is not the same. Unless someone resurrects the Life freeze Sacred Art lost with the death of the Первосвященник ── и unless Фанатио chooses to apply it to Berchie, her son will definitely get older than his mother и will eventually die. What an unbelievably cruel fate for both.

"Eternal life contradicts to the essence of the world."

— Ронье declared while restraining her anger hard, —

"It is absolutely forbidden to kill innocent people..... dozens of them, in search for such things......"

Зеппос’ face immediately distorted to a greater extent than ever before.

"Damned knights... how dare you saying such words at all?"

Black blood scattered from his mouth pronouncing curses.

*Even if Зеппос is minion as Тейза guesses, there is no guarantee that the body's contents are the same. It will be totally different from humans because it didn’t die even after the chest was damaged и belly were pierced with a thick stake, but it seems not to be just a clay of human type either. That blood как минимум appears to be flowing in the body, so if he loses all that blood he will die that time. The physique is much worse than of the real minion, so the amount of blood should be small too.*

Two of the three minions that appeared in the Obsidia castle were shattered in pieces by the fist of general commander Isukan, и the other one was split in two with the Меч-like hand slash by the ambassador Шейта. With skills of Ронье и the other one, it was difficult to give a fatal injury ── Кирито и others would call it "**damage**", but if one can slip through two knives и slash one of the limbs then there is a winner.

But the problem was Император Крюгер whom Зеппос was trying to protect. Three minutes or more have passed since they broke into the hall, и he was still singing. The longer the Sacred Art is, the longer, more complex и more powerful effects is produced, и Ронье was not aware of any so long technique. The incantation of the Past Reflection art that Асуна used felt quite long too, but still it would have been only about two minutes.

*We cannot prolong the fight with Зеппос. Rather than waiting for death of blood loss, the battle must be resolved at shortest, и then we’d stop the Император's incantation.*

"Тейза, when Я activate the secret move, stop his movements with light element technique."

 — when Ронье whispered this, her friend instantly nodded.

The Меч power, the sacred art power, и the incarnational power of the two were at the same levels. Тейза for sure would not want to impose a dangerous role on Ронье. However, there was a big difference between the two of them outside of their abilities. Тейза's Мира Людей army standard Меч must have had priority 25 и Ронье's Меч of the Moonlight’s priority was 39 — so it was Ронье who had to strike.

"...... certainly, neither Рыцари Целостности nor the Церковь Аксиом may be absolutely correct."

— while raising her beloved Меч overhead, Ронье shouted, —

"But even if we are sometimes not right, what you are doing here is definitely wrong whatever you say!"

As if the attitude of the owner was passed to it, the blade released a brilliant light blue shine. The moment Тейза began chanting the first line of Sacred Art, she kicked off the floor with the power of the whole body.

The invisible wings vigorously flapped behind her back, creating a tremendous acceleration. Instantaneously she shot through a distance of more than 10 mel и approached the enemy. Incrad style high-speed rushing technique, "**Sonic Leap**".

"You too shall be food for our ambitions, little girley!"

— Зеппос shouted out, grinning with pointed yellow fang-like teeth. He carelessly got better hold of the knives in both hands и tried to catch Ронье.

A pure white shine wrapped his evil words.

Three high-pitched pops overlapped with bang. Light bullets Тейза released had overtaken Ронье in the air.

Light elements were not as powerful as thermal or cryogenic elements, but with their overwhelming flight speed и hit accuracy, they were optimal to cause dizziness. Moreover, it became a counter anti-attribute to minion made with the power of darkness, so it was able to give some damage.

Purple smoke rose from the Зеппос’ face burned by intense light. The movement stopped only for a moment, but it was enough for Ронье.

The light blue flash passed diagonally between the two knives being swung down.

The Меч of the Moonlight bit deeply into the right shoulder of the former great chamberlain и exited the body under the left armpit. A cracked voice groaned from Зеппос’ mouth while he stiffened in a daunting pose.

"...... Крюгер, ...... your...... majesty......"

The upper half of the split body slid to the lower left и dropped onto the carpet with a thud. Slightly behind, the lower body also collapsed to the knees.

Ронье avoided the black blood which gushed from the cut surface of the two body pieces by leaping beside.

The moment she was convinced that this time he’s dead, power left her entire body, but the battle had not ended yet. Before the incantation is completed, they had to also defeat Император Крюгер.

In front of her eyes, there was soundlessly swaying candles ring. Inside, the three mountain гоблинов laying, with their eyes closed. и beyond that, man in a black robe, keeping both hands up и continuing to cast the incantation ──

*If that is the case that the reborn Император is also a minion, he cannot be defeated by a half-power attack. Like Зеппос, Я need to break his body or behead him.*

Ронье brought her Меч up again to activate the secret move.

The next moment, several things happened at the same time.

"Ронье!!"

— Тейза exclaimed behind her,

"Зеппос, do your duties!"

— The Император roared interrupting the cast,

**Ga~ts**!!!

— a heavy impact hit Ронье's right foot.

A bit later, a tremendous pain ran up to her head. Looking down she saw Зеппос who became only a head и a left arm thrusting the knife deeply to the instep of the right foot. With blade glittering green.

Intense numbness followed the pain, и Ронье clenched teeth. The poison had to be dealt with before it spreads throughout the whole body, but there were many kinds of poisoning techniques, и it is not possible to judge which kind of sacred art should be used unless the identity of poison is defined.

"Kh...!!!"

While groaning, she cut Зеппос’ left arm off with a Меч. Grabbed the guard of the poisoned knife и pulled it out of the foot. The blood streaming from the wound was already dark.

At the very least, in order to delay the circulation of the poison, Ронье generated five light elements, then deeply cut the leg above her right knee with a Меч. Blood flowed again, but its color was still barely red. To allow the light elements into the wound, she converted them to fog using the "**Mist Shape**" command и blended into the blood.

*With this, poison и light should cancel each other to some extent, but to completely detox, it is necessary to use a special technique with medicinal herb that is contained in the carrying bag on the waist. The time’s running out, Я have no choice but to use the first toxin decomposition technique which I’ll remember.*

Ронье was thinking so while trying to open the carrying bag with her left hand, but the sense of the fingertips was already dull и she could not unravel the strap. Also, the power was leaving from the left leg as well as from the injured right leg, her body violently shook и tilted ──

"Ронье!"

— Тейза, who ran from behind, supported collapsing Ронье. Carefully swinging the Меч, she cut the head of Зеппос who was still watching from the floor.

The sharp metal sound **Kiin**! overlapped the dull sound something made of clay could produce. Зеппос’ head, which was split in two from the crown to the chin, apparently, had completely lost the Life this time, lost its shape и smoothly melted. The lower body that was kneeling nearby also turned into black mucus, и after it spread around the floor it quickly started to evaporate.

There was a strange thing falling in the place where Зеппос’ head disappeared. Silvery ring<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> with petals of lily и feathers of a bird of prey ─ an emblem given to those serving Император Норлангарт house, petals и feathers representing the top-ranking ones.

The ring was cut in two pieces. The Тейза’s Меч has broken it. A sort of purple smoke was rising from the cut, и soon it disappeared with a sound resembling a faint scream.

*This strange thing is the core of the mystery why Зеппос и the Император who should have died were resurrected as minions. Perhaps, no, for sure there is something contained in the Император’s head, which gives the character и personality to the clay body.*

"Tie......se."

Ронье called her best friend, resisting the numbness that was finally reaching the mouth.

*── Cut the Император's head. This way you can defeat him.*

She wanted to continue, but her mouth wouldn’t move anymore. Тейза hugging Ронье with her left hand had thrown the Меч on the floor и was searching hard in the carrying bag. Rather than defeating the Император, she decided to cure Ронье. This decision cannot be blamed. If the situation is the opposite, Ронье would also do the same.

Behind the black hood drawn down to the eyes, Крюгер thinly smiled. Nothing like a sorrow for Зеппос who was supposed to be his long-time supported to die for the second time reflected in that smile.

"**Connect All Circuit! Open Gate!**"

— the Император raised both hands up to the limit, sharply bent the tall slender body, и shouted with a voice resembling a cracked bell.

Ронье did not understand the meaning of the phrase at all. But guided by some kind of instinct, she hardly turned the numbing neck.

The high ceiling of the large hall was painted black и there were decorative chandeliers hanging, that seemed to be expensive, but not lit. However, Ронье's eyes were drawn to the middle of the ceiling — to a circular hole just above the lying гоблинов.

*The diameter is about 30 cen. It wasn’t a neat job, the shape is distorted, и the wood is left scratched as it was. Perhaps it was a rough digging through the second-floor room floor with something like an ax.*

*For what such a thing could......* the confusion immediately changed to shivering.

Because something filthy-black was shaking at the back of the hole. Highly viscous, like mud. It closely resembled the clay-like material that the body of dead Зеппос was made of.

Ронье и Тейза both looked up и watched the black clay, or mucus, drooped down out of the hole. It moved as if being extruded with a strong pressure, or as if it crawling out by its own will.

Mucus swelled like a balloon, waved, wriggled — и burst with a horrible sound.

In front of their eyes, the flood of mucus fell on the floor like a waterfall instantly sinking mountain гоблинов underneath. The stream ended after the heap of mucus reached the height of more than 2 mel, but the wriggling where the caught creatures were buried did not stop. It continued trembling, waving, seething with гоблинов inside.

"............!!!"

— Тейза exclaimed и quickly retreated while holding Ронье.

The latter could only desperately clench the handle of beloved Меч with her right hand which had already lost sensitivity as the influence of the poison spread over the entire body. If what knife was covered with was a lethal poison, it is supposed that her life was rapidly decreasing, but the numb body could not even feel pain.

Despite understanding the need to use detoxification procedure immediately, Ронье could not take her eyes off the wrinkling black mucus.

The mucus which was an amorphous heap split into three parts after some more trembling. It spread over the floor reaching the ring of candles, и as it absorbed them, flames disappeared one after another.

The only light illuminating the hall that moment were sunset rays hardly flowing in through the window Тейза broke, и also some from the corridor through the big door Ронье kicked open. Both were weak и hardly reached the center of the hall.

The two watched, stunned, as the mucus continued to change into a human shape after becoming the three huge shadows.

Strong upper body, swollen straw rope-like muscles. Oddly long arms. Two legs bent like goats’ ones. The wings folded on the back, и the tail hanging to the floor.

It closely resembled the figures of minion seen at the Obsidia Castle. But there was one important difference.

The original minion had a circular mouth at the tip of a long hagfish-like<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> head, и two round eyes are lined up one on each side. But the head of a monster standing in front of them was much closer to humans, with a sharp nose и pointed ears, и two half-closed eyes.

"That face ............ гоблинов’............?"

— Тейза muttered with trembling voice. Indeed, the face of the monster closely resembled mountain гоблинов, but there were no rat-like teeth. Countless fangs stuck out of a wide mouth stretching between two sides of a bald head.

Unexpectedly, Зеппос’ words he said a few minutes ago echoed in her mind:

*── Because it is a perfect match for гоблинов combat training, without the need to pass that hidden passage...*

For these three minions in front of them, or rather for the three mountain гоблинов transformed by the Император's technique и the power of black mucus, it was certainly impossible to go down the stairs to the dungeon anymore. The length of your body would be as long as two и a half mels, their heads would reach the ceiling if they fully extend the bent legs.

*Зеппос ─ perhaps, also the Император ─ were revived as a humanoid minions by embedding their dead corpses in clay after the Rebellion of Four Империиs. и the three гоблинов were taken into the clay alive и transformed into huge minions.  
There must be someone further standing in the shadows of the two phenomena. Someone who used the remnants to revive the Император и the other one, и taught them minions manufacturing method. и that person must be the key to a kidnapping incident in Obsidia Castle и a series of events in Мира Людей.  
But, rather than that, we should think about how to restore the гоблинов.  
If we destroy minions in a normal way, гоблинов will definitely die as well. It is necessary to remove only the black clay without hurting them who still should be inside. It may be possible if we hit the anti-attribute, light element, in large amounts, but as much as 10 or even 20 might not be enough. Moreover, there is probably not much sacred power remaining in this hall.*

"Ронье, drink this."

Suddenly, a small bottle was brought to her mouth accompanied with such a whisper. She thought it was an elixir to restore Life, but the smell was different. While Ронье thought about all those things, Тейза seemed to have made antidote with available media и sacred art.

The liquid that flowed into her mouth was intensely bitter, but she felt that the numbness of the tongue melted after drinking just a single drop. But how did Тейза identify the kind of poison in Ронье's body?

As if reading the doubt in the eyes, her best friend whispered again:

"That knife was probably the ‘poisonous Ruberyl steel’. I’ve never seen the real thing before, but it was similar to the color Linel told."

The other one agreed solely by moving her eyes.

Рыцарь Целостности Linel Синтез Twenty-Eight и her fellow Fizel Синтез Twenty-Nine were the main characters of a story of how they tried to paralyze Кирито и Юдзио и get them kill by poison Меч. Despite being reliable senior knights, they used to share knowledge somewhat different from the other knights, и probably that was the source from which Тейза may have learned about poison Меч.

Hardly moving the lips that just got barely relieved from paralysis, Ронье whispered:

"Тейза...... that Minion, do not kill. Need to save the гоблинов-сан."

"...... Got it."

Тейза nodded deeply и glanced at the broken window:

"But it is impossible to dissolve three Minion bodies with light-element art. As soon as Ронье can move, we will escape from here."

"……but……"

Император и minion may disappear if Ронье и she escape. Minion can fly in the sky even if it cannot go downstairs to the dungeon. Tracking is impossible without a dragon.

"Я know, but we have no choice."

With a painful look, Тейза brought the mouth close to Ронье's ears и said:

"If the art does not work, и we have to use a Меч...... perhaps we won’t be able to slay that Minion."

"............!!"

Ронье sharply inhaled.

That was exactly right. Mountain гоблинов are integral parts of minions и they could be killed by slashing through; и even if they with Ронье decide that they should do so, there is high possibility that their bodies won’t obey the intention. The "seal of the right eye" ──

However, it was not limited to them. Other Рыцари Целостности, и even guards of the Мира Людей Defense Army who share the same iron rule: "In order to protect the peace between Мира Людей и Тёмной Территории, we must never injure a sub-human"<sup><a href="#Prim6">6</a></sup>, will fall into the same situation.

What if there are not only these three?

The Рыцарь Целостности team won’t be able to fight back "sub-humans forced to transform into minions" attacking Центория in dozens or hundreds.

No, even more terrible things can happen than that.

Император Крюгер и Зеппос abducted the mountain гоблинов и transformed them into minions in order to cause a new war between Мира Людей и Тёмной Территории. If these minions attack Центория и after a large number of casualties it turns out that their actual identities are гоблинов, the influence of that would not be limited to the Язен’s murder scale. The anger и hatred far exceeding the ones of former Войны с Внешним Миром would rise и the people of Мира Людей will have the genuine wish to begin a reverse invasion into the Тёмной Территории.

In order to avoid that definite catastrophe, some knights may be able to break the seal of the right eye и fight minions.

However, what if the one who is behind the Император, instead of clashing the two worlds, wants just to break the present order on its own — to end the rule of the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей?

Instead of sub-humans, they could convert Мира Людей people into minions.

Today, there will be at most two hundred or three hundred tourists from Тёмной Территории staying in Мира Людей. Even if they somehow abduct all of them, that would be the upper limit for the number of minions that can be made. However, the total population of Мира Людей exceeds 80000. With the clay as the material, one can prepare as many bodies as they need.

After Мира Людей people get transformed into minions, Рыцари Целостности will not be able to fight any of them.

After controlling the Объединённого Совета Мира Людей with an army of minions, it would be even possible to invade the Тёмной Территории и even defeat the Тёмной Территории army. It is nothing more but the return of "Меч skeleton soldiers plan" that the Первосвященник Администратор had been attempting.

Ронье, who had thought about this for a while, watched the shadow of the Император Крюгер through the gap between the three minions, which still hadn’t moved.

Whether he had been exhausted by a long-time high-level incantation, he stuck one knee on the floor. Despite that, the evil wickedness emanating from his black robe appearance, did not appear to fade away. He remained the same or even more malicious than the kidnapper trying to kill the baby Lisetta in Obsidia Castle.

*Я ultimately cannot let this man to escape.*

And the Император moved as if he felt Ронье’s determination. He staggeringly stood up, passed between minions which remained in the standby posture, и stopped before Ронье.

"...... Я did not recognize the style, but it was a splendid secret move, girl."

Ронье was unable to respond quickly to that surprising words she did not expect. But the Император did not seem to care, he kept talking in crackling voice from behind the hood:

"Not simply murdering, but also slashing away Hozaica’s left arm."

She shivered trying to remember the killing, which he talked of with such an emotionless casual voice, but still she could not remember the name he called. To be exact, she felt like she heard it somewhere, but could not remember details easily.

In lieu of Ронье who raised the eyebrows, Тейза exhaled "Eh......". The arms holding Ронье's body slightly stiffened.

"....... Hozaica Eastabarieth......?"

"Yes...... They used to call him this name at that time."

Listening to that interaction, Ронье finally realized who it was.

One who lost his life in the Rebellion of Four Империиs, the Император of the Eastabarieth Империи.

However, Император Крюгер misunderstood something. In the battle of a year ago Ронье и Тейза rushed into the Северной Центория Imperial castle, и never stepped into the Восточной Центория. They were knight Nergius и knight Entokia who attacked the Восточной Центория Imperial castle и slashed Император Hozaica.

In the first place, there were only three people, including Зеппос who died a few minutes ago, whom Ронье defeated using a secret move. The first one was the Император Крюгер, и the second one was a black robe kidnapper whom she fought on the top floor of Obsidia Castle.

At that time, Ронье slashed kidnapper’s left arm with the same "Sonic Leap" as she did just now.

Left arm.......

All of a sudden, thanks to the antidote, the feeling came back to Ронье, from toes to the eyelids. In her head, the kidnapper’s voice faintly echoed:

*── Well, so it was the Мира Людей Премьер-Мечник who slashed the sealing chain? This person is more troublesome than his reputation.......*

That day, should the kidnapper be of Тёмной Территории people, he could not hear rumors of Мира Людей Премьер-Мечник. Both times Кирито visited Obsidia, including the last time, were incognito, so the people of the city never had a chance to even see Премьер-Мечник.

"Did...... did you mean......"

Roughly moving dry lips, Ронье decided to confirm the true meaning of Император's words.

"Was the kidnapper who appeared in the Obsidia Castle the Eastabarieth Император, who survived as minion just like you...?"

To that question, Крюгер suggestively lifted the pointed mustache:

"You have not found the corpse of Hozaica, have you?"

— и shook his right hand quickly before Ронье said anything:

"Do not worry, that person is dead. Dead bodies that fell to the ground melt и disappear...... just like Зеппос did."

These words confirmed that the kidnapper was Император Hozaica in a form of a minion. But that led to a new doubt.

"...... How would you know such a thing while you were in Мира Людей?"

Who asked that was Тейза, not Ронье.

Император Крюгер did not reply by words, but spread the black robe on his chest.

There, hanging on a thin chain, was a blood-red jewel shining even in the dark. Kidnapper — Император Hozaica — had exactly the same on his chest.

"Again, Hozaica’s plan was destroyed и he died. When 'katashiro'<sup><a href="#Prim7">7</a></sup> also breaks, he cannot be resurrected anymore. However, what he observed was passed over, becoming the cornerstone of the next plan...... that's it. The same way we made this fusion-type minion... prototypes of them, which will strand you knights."

As he said so, satisfied Крюгер stroked Minion's powerful arm with his left hand.

Ронье desperately thought while startle и shock quickly converted to a saturated horror in her head.

*Katashiro, that badge that came out from the head of Зеппос. Although the overall mechanism is not clear, that was an essential element for the resurrection technique using minions as a material.  
The Император Hozaica, whose arms were cut off by ambassador Шейта и Ронье, threw himself out of the window on the top floor of Obsidia Castle. The corpse was not found not because he flew away or ran, the katashiro was destroyed when he fell, и the clay body melted.  
But if we believe in Крюгер's words, the red gem that Hozaica had hanging on his chest did not break. Moreover, by some means it moved over three thousand kilolu from Obsidia to Норлангарт Империи и gave Крюгер the memory и knowledge of Hozaica ──  
If the guess so far is correct.  
That red gemstone is the heart of a gigantic conspiracy intertwining Мира Людей и Тёмной Территории.*

Ронье strongly clasped the beloved Меч with the right hand, already purified from paralysis poison и able to move again.

*Я cannot let you go away here. Even if Я could defeat the Император Крюгер, if the gem disappears somewhere, there must be someone who inherits the accumulated mАлиса.*

"Тейза...... somehow attract minions for just 30 seconds."

— Ронье whispered at such a volume that she could barely hear it herself.

"After slashing the Император, гоблинов may return to the original."

It was a slight hope, but как минимум they can earn some time if there is no one to control them.

The problem was that the poison hasn’t come out of the wounds above the right knee и right instep. Strong posture was essential for secret Меч moves, as well as to release several whole-body blows. Still there was no choice but to try.

"...... I’ve got it."

Тейза who was supporting Ронье’s back also replied with the quietest voice.

She moved the fingers of both hands и feet a little again, to confirm that the sensation is back. Thanks to the Император talking about it, she gained time to get the medicine to work, but surely the same is true for the other party. Император’s mental exhaustion — regardless of whether there is any spirit in the head of minion made of pure clay — seemed to have passed, и the skin surface of the fusion-type minions also became shinier than when freshly made.

Император Крюгер stroke the minion's arm again with his fingertips и nodded, satisfied:

"Well, according to the plan, Зеппос was supposed to be the opponent for the combat training, but he died. Let me take that responsibility for you."

While talking, he went in the back. Probably, the intention was for minions to kill them.

The prototype minions, which Император Hozaica used in Obsidia Castle, accepted limited set of very simple commands in sacred words or Тёмной Территории people words. Moreover, their thinking power was at a wild bВосточной degree, it could not deal with Рыцари Целостности' Меч skill и complicated tactics that make use of Sacred Art. At the time of the Войны с Внешним Миром, 800 precious minions introduced by the Dark Arts Masters Guild could not recognize the trap of full armament control technique that the knight chief Беркули set up, и all of them were destroyed in a blink of an eye.

*The time at which the fusion-type minions incorporating the гоблинов inside have evolved above the original has probably come. They must be able to understand more advanced и diverse instructions. But of course, it will take time to give multiple orders. Take advantage of the chance и kill the Император that moment.*

Император Крюгер who returned behind Minions who stood side by side raised his right hand upwards as if giving orders to a soldier under his command.

"Minions! Kill these two girls! ── **Activate**!!"

That was the only command issued. In Мира Людей language и one word of sacred language.

With sound of something starting to vibrate, minions’ eyes began glowing red.

Immediately after, with the speed that made their giant figures blurry, the right и left minions made powerful jumps. The left minion stood before the broken window и the right minion stopped in front of the large open door.

They confined Ронье и others in the hall. In order to carry out the command of "killing", they decided that command objects must not escape, и blocked two possible escape routes.

Ронье realized that the calculation she did a few seconds ago was wrong. The fusion-type minion had an ability to recognize the situation и to accept complicated instructions, и beyond that — judge oneself и move accordingly.

However, since the two blocked the escape routes, there was only one minion remaining in front of Император Крюгер. They couldn’t hit a fusion-type minion built on top of innocent гоблинов, but they could avoid his attacks и slay the Император.

*── Тейза!*

Her friend who responded to the thought that thrusted forward the hands supporting her back, as the result pushing Ронье ahead. At the same time, Ронье also kicked off the floor with the injured right foot. Blood sprayed from the boot и knee, the pain engulfing her was like a burning skewer penetrating through the entire body, but she clenched teeth и endured it.

Minion showed an unbelievably agile reaction to the super high-speed rush which combined the power of the two knights. With growling, the long log-like thirty cen-wide right arm came down intending to mow Ронье. Sharp sickle-like nails sprung out from tips of the fingers; if they hit, one will be torn apart.

But Ронье predicted that attack.

Regardless of how high fusion-type minions’ abilities are, the overall shape is almost the same as the original minion. Then, like the origin, they should use claws of both hands as the main weapon.

"**Kh**......!!!"

While unconsciously leaking a groan from behind the clenched teeth, she let the atrociously looking claws to target her for as long as possible, и just before the hit, bent the upper body to the back.

Sliding on the floor feet first, she dove under the attack. The claws of thin fingers reached the disturbed hair, и ends were cut by about 3 cens, but it was a cheap price.

Minion swayed to the left because of the momentum of the whole-body swoosh и turned his back on Ронье. This minion mimicked the shape of a human even more than previous ones, it could not attack from this position. When she brought the body back up by slightly hooking the left foot to the carpet, there was the figure of Император Крюгер in just seven mel ahead.

*Definitely within the range of a "Sonic Leap". With one whole-body blow, destroy the katashiro that should be stored in the middle of the head и the red jewel hanging on the chest, и end it all.*

When she kicked off the floor again with the blooded right foot, vigorously swinging the Меч of the Moonlight up ──

It happened at that very moment.

Something black и slender jumped like a whip from the floor sinking in the darkness, и rushed with incredible speed aiming at Ронье's neck.

Reflectively she lifted the left arm to protect the neck.

In several hundredths of a second, the black whip struck the left forearm.

*── This is minion's tail.*

The fusion-type minion used the momentum of one whole-body turn to swing the tail, the only weapon capable of attacking from the back, и at a speed higher than the right arm would do.

The moment Ронье recognized it there was the sound of crumbling left arm bones. The braided wire-hard tail, without stopping, painfully hit Ронье's chest и another arm и sent her flying through the air backwards with a tremendous momentum.

Ронье who flew more than 10 mel through the air crashed into the back wall и bounced down to the floor.

*Everything is black. Я cannot breathe. Seems it has broken also several ribs on top of my left arm, but the impact that my whole body received is so huge that Я cannot even feel pain.*

Despite she thought of standing up, the body did not move at all. Although she wore light metal armor on the chest, it seems that Life has been reduced to a dangerous value with a single blow.

"Ронье ── !!!"

Тейза was calling her name from somewhere distant. She hardly managed to move the face touching the floor, opened the darkened и cloudy eyes.

She could see her best friend appearing from the front left side. и a huge shadow abruptly attacking from the right side.

*....... Тейза, run away.*

An attempt to shout, but only some air flew out of the throat.

Тейза who noticed minion aiming at himself stopped running и tried to deflect the attack.

However, at the moment when she swiftly swayed the Меч, her appearance unnaturally stiffened.

The "seal of the right eye" has been activated. She forgot herself because of Ронье's injuries и tried to attack the minion reflexively, but then remembered that there was a гоблин enclosed in the enemy's body.

Ронье has never experienced a seal effect until that moment. But she heard that the pain is like the soul is being directly crushed down. As far as Ронье was aware, the only people who managed to break through the seal with their own will were elite мечник-стажёр Юдзио, Рыцарь Целостности Алиса, the ork chief Rirupirin, и adding General Commander Isukan who got the right eye out himself, there were only four people in total.

Minion with all his force mowed through Тейза's body which was attacked by so much pain that became frozen. Fresh blood painted four long trails in the air, и Ронье screamed forgetting about her deep wounds.

Тейза collapsed on the floor, bounced back и rolled right up to Ронье. She seemed to have lost her consciousness, и wouldn’t move the closed eyelids. A massive amount of blood continued to flow from deep wounds torn by minion’s claws.

"Tei.......se......."

Ронье desperately crawled on the floor while spitting blood from her mouth, lifted the broken left arm и touched the partner's body. Without treating her with luminous elements right now, Тейза will die.

"**Siste...... ko...l**"

She tried hard but couldn’t activate the art with the lack of voice. The left barely holding Тейза’s wounds already dyed red up to the wrist.

Рыцари Целостности had much higher armor и equipment authority и Sacred Art authority than the Мира Людей guards, и they exercised the overwhelming muscle power, but the numerical value of Life itself did not change much compared to an ordinary human. The maximum values for strong senior knights were about 5000, while Ронье и Тейза who were only 17 years old had just about 3000<sup><a href="#Prim8">8</a></sup>.

Even if she couldn’t say it aloud, the Stacia’s window could be displayed if she draws the sacred character. However, Ронье did not have the courage to see the Тейза's remaining Life amount. Just dropping tears down, she held the wound with her left hand, continuing attempts to pronounce the incantation.

**Kin**, a sound echoed on the opposite side of the hall. Minion that drove two people to the moribund state, picked up Тейза’s standard Меч that fell to the floor, и tossed it away.

The rest two did not move away from the broken window и the big door. It seemed that they judged that only one is enough to kill Ронье и her. That one, with a steadfast gait, was approaching in order to deliver the finishing blow.

"Ку-Ку-ku...... Ку-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

— Император Крюгер blasted in distorted laughter in the middle of the hall.

"Amazing. Just one...... и this is a fighting power for just a гоблин-based fusion? Я have heard that soil blended with lots of blood и bones makes it a stronger minion, but isn’t it more than expected? After they died they still dedicate themselves to the surplus, Я must praise my former serfs for what they do...... Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

Ронье couldn’t even think about the meaning of words that reached her ears anymore.

It was getting darker и darker in her eyes. Император’s loud laughter dissolved away. The sensitivity only remained in the left hand immersed in the blood of Тейза. Its temperature was gradually fading.

Finally, minion that came in front of her eyes swung up the left и right arms at the same time.

Unexpectedly ──

Right hand felt a gentle warmth.

She did not immediately understand what the hand was holding. It was a handle of the Меч of the Moonlight, carefully wrapped with a slightly rough leather.

**To-kun**, **to-kun**, through the pulsing heat Меч spoke to her. Unleash me, for Я will respond.

*However, Я can’t do "that thing". Меч of the Moonlight is certainly a high priority instrument, but it is not a divine object.  
Sacred treasure is a weapon made from a legendary essence such as a divine animal<sup><a href="#Prim9">9</a></sup> or a sacred tree, not a metal refined by a person. That is why sacred treasures have their own memories и can communicate with their masters.  
On the other hand, it was some human blacksmith who forged the Меч of the Moonlight, so there is no memory of the preceding existence. Although it may become familiar with hands enough to accustom itself to the user, but to cause further phenomena, it simply cannot.  
Cannot. Cannot…….*

On the verge of her и Тейза’s death, as the time became weirdly stretched, in her head Ронье was repeating the single word over и over.

Suddenly, she felt as if she has heard a new voice.

*── Not only the Меч. Even clothes, shoes, tableware...... every single particle generated by sacred art, if you open your heart и share your love they will surely respond. Maybe, people too.......*

She had heard that a long time ago somewhere far away, the words of the deceased elite мечник-стажёр Юдзио.

To open the heart.

It was the owner Ронье who had decided that Меч of the Moonlight had no spirit. But looking back at what happened there, it was Вице-Премьер-Мечник Асуна who told her to pick one of the three Мечs, but it was Ронье who was left with the choice of the Меч, not her. At that moment, something drifted Ронье's right hand, attracted it to this Меч with the silver guard in a form of a crescent moon.

And now, the Меч which Ронье named "Moonlight" was speaking to her to help its troubled owner. Believe in the Меч, open your heart и release it’s memory.

With warmth transmitted from the handle to the right hand, и the warmth of the left hand immersed in Тейза’s blood transmitted to the core of her body, Ронье cried out using all her modest powers:

"**Enhance Armament!**"

She intended to scream, but the voice was so weak that she could barely hear it herself.

But the Меч и the essence of the world responded to Ронье’s call.

The guard и blade of the Меч of the Moonlight emitted a dazzlingly bright silver shine. The moment it was shined by the light, minion that was on the verge of descending the claws of both hands, jumped back, и the other two blocking the exit, together with Император Крюгер who continued to laugh loudly, covered the eyes, twisted bodies.

At the same time, Ронье felt that the pain in the right leg pierced by a knife и in the left arm crushed by the tail, goes away. The blood streaming from Тейза’s wounds also rapidly reduced the flow.

'Complete armament control'.

Essence of incarnational force that only the top knights can use with divine objects, a true mystery.

Perhaps the Меч of the Moonlight released part of its own Life as an enhanced version of the light element healing art. It was a fairly simple category of a complete armament control, but it was a true miracle that Ронье, who has only been a year since becoming an apprentice knight, was able to activate it without doing the full-scale study first.

The light of the blade continued for more than ten seconds, then gradually faded little by little, flashed couple of times и disappeared.

Bleeding from deep cuts carved through Тейза’s body ceased, a little bit of redness returned to the face. However, consciousness has not returned yet, и Ронье's left arm и right foot were not completely cured.

On the other hand, three minions were burned with the anti-attribute light и gray smoke was rising from their whole bodies, but they have not decomposed yet. Apparently, the damage is superficial и they will start moving soon.

*Я do not want to let the Император go, but Я cannot exchange Тейза's life to his one. Я have to escape from the hall before minions attack again.*

She gathered up the energy that Меч of the Moonlight gave them и rose up with Тейза on her left hand. As for the exit, the door to the hallway was larger, but if minion follows, they will not be able to escape. There was no choice but to go to the front yard through the broken window.

"Тейза, try hard a little more!"

— Ронье whispered to her dying best friend и began running to a window 15 mels away.

With every step, a pain burst in sparkles over her left arm и right leg. She suddenly felt bad и throat got sore.

Another ten mels. Eight mels. Seven mels.......

"Minions, close the window!"

— shouted Император Крюгер who seems to have recovered from the spiritual light damage from the center of the hall.

"**Shyu-gooo**!!"

Minions, despite being similar to mountain гоблинов, did not have similar voices; which responded was the one curled near the broken window. Stood in front of the escape path, expanded the wings of both arms и barked. The window Тейза broke became completely hidden by the huge body, и the color of the sun went away.

Also, behind, two other minions barked one after another.

To escape, they needed to eliminate the one in front of the window. But Ронье couldn’t attack the fusion-type minion. Even just trying to slash its leg to make it stop moving will trigger the "seal of the right eye" и she will not be able to move just like Тейза previously.

*The only remaining means is to just use complete armament control. If it has curative spirit, burning the flesh of Minion should not hurt the гоблинов inside. But how much more Меч of the Moonlight's Life has left? Я cannot afford confirming it through the Stacia’s window.  
Меч of the Moonlight will crumble if it runs out of Life by complete armament control.  
Still.  
If it is to save Тейза, will the Меч forgive me?*

While desperately thinking, Ронье tried to hold up the Меч in her right hand.

Suddenly, something was heard.

Countless resonating silver bells. As if all stars и planets of entire sky started to make boisterously noise.

Hundreds of angels sing like

LA ─────────

Along with the spectacular sound, a rainbow of light poured down through the ceiling of the hall.

*This light is as clean as if it doesn’t belong to this world, but it doesn’t damage minions.* She blinked red eyes, и looked up at the ceiling, perplexed.

Suddenly a thin grid of light ran through the ceiling.

Light was becoming more и more thick. The ceiling was being decomposed into dozens of boards. Although the boards were completely separated, they did not fall at all for some reason. While floating in the air, they skidded sideways.

It was not only the ceiling being disassembled. The walls of the second floor, the roof, even the furniture was wrapped in rainbow-colored light, и they were separated и moved outwards without any sound. It was as if the house, previously assembled from precise building blocks crumbled from the inside.

The wave of disassembly finally reached the walls of the first floor. The gray stone composing the stone walls that seemed to be quite sturdy broke apart и moved to the front yard. A glass window left the frame и chased it.

The vast mansion was completely decomposed, leaving only the floor in only a matter of ten seconds. Angels singing dissolved, rainbow-colored light faded.

Immediately afterwards, a myriad of building blocks floating outside the floor dropped with tremendous roar.

When the echo of thunderous destruction sound fell, Ронье was not in the mansion anymore. Her feet were still in a dark carpet, but the evening reddening sky spread overhead. The lower edge of crimson Solus touched the Mountain Range at the Edge; the Северной wind still full of winter coldness shook hair of the two.

Three minions и Император Крюгер froze, stunned. If it had been an original minion that simply obeys instructions, it would have continued attacking without any concern for changes around, but because the fusion type one had a kind of consciousness, it seemed to be confused about what to do.

But Ронье’s head stopped working the same exact way. A large hall she thought there was no hope to escape — no, the entire Император's villa filled with mАлиса и fear couldn’t oppose against the super phenomenon that decomposed it completely within about ten seconds.

"... Ронье"

Suddenly a faint voice reached her left ear. Then at last the thinking ability returned, и she called the name with the same blurred voice.

"Тейза......!"

Her best friend regained consciousness, but was not looking at Ронье. Her autumn leaves-colored eyes did not move away from a point in the Южной sky.

Ронье looked up too, filled with curiosity.

A small shadow floated around the boundary of wide sky dyed bright golden yellow и madder red.

One, not two. A woman wearing a pearl dress, her long brown hair flutters on the breeze. The right hand lowering a fine naked Меч.

And a man with black hair wearing clothes both top и bottom colored black too, his right hand wrapped around woman’s waist. The hem of the cloak deformed into gently flapping dragon wings.

Ронье who opened both eyes to the limit also noticed what the woman was firmly holding with her left arm. A creature wrapped in light-yellow feathers. Little dragon with long neck и tail и small wings.

"....... Цукигаке......"

— she muttered with shivering voice, trying hard to breathe in while feeling something hot burning in the throat. и called the names of the two people:

"Асуна-сама....... Кирито-сенпай......"

Small Цукигаке ran hard to Центория и brought them here. The rainbow-colored light that decomposed the large mansion must be the power of Stacy God, "unlimited terrain manipulation", which only Асуна possesses in whole Underworld.

Somewhat later than Ронье и Тейза, Император Крюгер seemed to also have noticed the existence of people overlooking him from a far height. He bent loosely hanging fingers of the right hand bent like claws with creaking sound loud enough to hear even for Ронье who was standing away.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p315.jpg)

"............ Объединённого Совета Мира Людей...... Премьер-Мечник. For how long will you disturb us?"

The emitted voice was distorted и cracked as if it were a curse. The black robe's skirt abruptly turned, и a thin like a dead tree branch left arm pointed to the sky:

"Minions, shoot down those irreverents!"

Three fusion-type minions which received a new order quickly turned their faces towards the sky, opened the pointed mouth wide. Purple miasma wriggled eerily behind the rows of sharp fangs.

*No way fused minion can have attacking belch...... that would be "**breath**" in sacred language, like dragons’ fire stream?*

"Сенпай! You are being targeted!"

— Ронье desperately shouted, but her voice was too weak, she did not think that it reached the two floating as high as 100 mels.

But Кирито, as if responding to Ронье’s callout, casually stretched his right hand down from the sky. There was a long black Меч shining gold in the sunset in it. Кирито’s divine object, "Меч Ночного Неба".

Three minions opened their mouths to the limit, и tried to breath a dark-colored ray.

Suddenly the surroundings rapidly darkened.

In the beginning, Ронье thought that the streams from minions’ mouths blocked the sunlight. But she quickly understood that was not the case. It was not only in the vicinity of minions that it got dark. The forest surrounding the mansion sank in black shadows, despite a bright scarlet illuminating it moments ago. The sunset sky became dark purple, и even some stars were twinkling in it.

And even Solus floating just above the Западной horizon lost its light as if it had been dimmed by Lunaria.

Within this suddenly fallen night, there was only one intensely shining thing.

The Меч Ночного Неба Кирито was holding in his right hand. The blade glowed so dazzling golden light that it could not even be looked directly at.

It seemed that Император Крюгер was also frightened by the new super phenomenon, which even exceeded the deconstruction of the mansion. However, he raised his left hand again и shouted boldly.

"Doesn’t matter! Shoot them!!"

Three minions thrusted up heads that froze a moment и vigorously launched a shining purple light stream.

Unlike the fire stream of a dragon, it was a sphere with elongated tail. Toward the miasmic mass that rushed at them with a strange sound reminiscent of the bВосточной scream, Кирито sharply swung the Меч Ночного Неба down.

The vision of Ронье burned pure white.

Although she could not help narrowing her eyes because of too bright glare, Ронье tried to see what was going on without turning her face away.

It was a huge number of particles emitting white light. Pure heatless white light filled the surrounding space.

At first, miasmic breath kept rising while eating the light grains, but then sharply decreased, as if a body of ice fell into hot water, и disappeared without a trace.

"............... This all, light elements...?"

Ронье silently nodded to Тейза's whispering.

*By shade и movement, these light spots are nothing but familiar light elements. However, what the light element-based techniques are limited to, is that even if a high-level practitioner uses both fingers, there can be only ten elements generated at the same time.  
The number of light elements filling a wide surrounding space without gaps, at minimum is a few thousands...... и possibly more than a million.  
Я can infer how to generate it. Кирито's Меч Ночного Неба is equipped with an ability to absorb sacred power from the surrounding space itself — to be precise, it has "memory liberation technique" which is its superior power. With that power it sucked in the light of Solus и changed all the enormous amount of sacred power into light elements.*

However, the element disappears or gets out of control the moment caster loses the concentration. Beginning from the training of holding one element on one finger, a practitioner would be already considered a full-fledged cleric if he or she can control five elements on one hand, but higher-ranked masters can control even ten of those with two hands. Both Ронье и Тейза could operate only five elements at that time.

*How can he control tens thousands of elements at the same time?*

— Ронье amazedly stared at the light elements falling like sparkling snow.

On the other hand, minions opened their mouths again to shoot the miasmic breath.

It was then that the light that just drifted in space moved. Tens thousands of light elements flew altogether as if they have their own will и wrapped up three minions’ bodies in a swirl. Like at the time when Меч of the Moonlight emitted spiritual light, their skins cracked и unpleasantly smelling smoke rose up, but it did not last for long.

Numerous light elements penetrated one after another into dark-gray bodies, making it to glow from the inside in pure white.

Terrible monster, without a single scream, collapsed as liquid.

The splashing mucus evaporated while falling through the air, и mountain гоблинов rolled out of it. They were unconscious, clothes и accessories were all lost, but it seemed that they were not injured.

Some of the light elements wrapped around Ронье и Тейза и healed their scars. Although they felt like collapsing right here right now due to unparalleled warmth и comfort it generated, they tried hard to keep standing.

At the same time as the three fusion-type minions completely disappeared и Ронье's и Тейза’s injuries was healed, the sky also regained the sunset color.

Most of the huge number of light elements played their role и extinguished, but the last few hundreds were floating slightly above the floor forming ten rings. It was the Император Крюгер Норлангарт, of course, trapped in this slender cage created with those rings placed one above another. The rings sizes were just enough not touch the robe's cloth, и if he had moved just a little, the light elements would penetrate the clay body и decompose it in the same way as minions’ ones.

Under the sunset which got a little more reddish than before, the face of the man was completely shaded и the expression in the back of the hood could not be seen. However, it was unlikely that a person as arrogant as Император would have chosen to quietly become a prisoner.

"Тейза, can you stand?"

Her friend strongly nodded to this loud question:

"Yup, it's all right now. Thank you, Ронье."

"That's me who should... thank you, Тейза."

They hugged each other for a moment и let each other go. Ронье quickly checked the condition of injuries, it seemed that the broken left arm bones are not perfect but were holding together, и only thin scars remained on the right feet и right knees. Тейза, who was more seriously injured, seemed to have no difficulty moving either.

Тейза's standard Меч thrown away by a minion laid on the opposite side of the hall from which only floor remained. She stopped Тейза who tried to begin walking there with a left hand:

"Later. Keep an eye on the Император."

To Ронье’s words, her best friend nodded with tense facial expressions. She was worried about the mountain гоблинов lying on the floor, but there was also the possibility that the Император will try to use them again in some way. While carefully holding the Меч of the Moonlight, the other one gradually approached the cage of light elements.

Кирито и Асуна descend from the sky along a wide arc. Ронье и Тейза’s role was to make sure Император doesn’t do anything weird until the two land.

When two people stepped on the floor three meters from in the cage, black robe shook a little.

"Ку-ku, Ку-Ку-Ку-ku......"

 — sticky stifled laugh reached ears. A point of a Меч quickly aimed at him, but Император did not stop laughing.

"....... Крюгер Норлангарт. Your plans are already over, so please be quiet this time."

She spoke as severe as possible, и laughter finally stopped, but in spite of this, words came after, arrogant as usual:

"It is the repeating of what happened a year ago, girl. Could you imagine that back then Я have chosen the death filled with glory, и you will be humiliated this time?"

"...... Unlike back then, there is no such option this time."

"Option...... you say? You don’t understand. You don’t understand anything."

The Император who muttered the answer raised the hood a little. Ронье also glanced at the sky, и the Кирито’s group were already reaching just above the mansion. About two seconds or so remained until two people get down.

*For sure, there’s nothing he can do.*

Ронье's determination —

Император Крюгер outstripped in an unexpected way.

"I’m leaving for the time being, girl... See you again."

That said, the Император’s body collapsed forward.

"Ah……!"

— Тейза exclaimed и stretched her left hand, but there was nothing she could do. Light element rings, not thicker than one milis, cut through the Император Крюгер's body и the black robe. The clay body slices dropped to the floor one after another from top to bottom with heavy thuds.

Eleven black lumps quickly became mucus heaps и evaporated.

When Кирито и Асуна landed behind them, only a piece of black cloth и two units of jewelry remained on the carpet.

One was the golden ring with a hawk spreading it’s wings over a white lily engraved.

And the other one, glowing ominously on the dark chain, was a crimson gem ──

Кирито who has run to her, placed a hand onto Ронье’s shoulder:

"Sorry, Я got late! Are you OK?"

As soon as the tension has gone, Ронье felt like collapsing on the spot, but somehow she remained standing и looked in the face of Премьер-Мечник.

"Y-Yes, Я am fine. But the Император......."

"E-Император!?"

Despite Кирито was greatly surprised, she couldn’t proceed with detailed explanation. Because some yellowish mass flew out from the arms of Асуна who tried to nurse Тейза и clung to Ронье’s face.

"Кю-r-r-r!!!"

As soon as she heard the cry, tears flowed from both Ронье’s eyes.

"Цукигаке......!"

She left beloved Меч to Кирито и hugged the little dragon firmly with both hands.

Looking closely, she saw mud that stuck to the feathers of Цукигаке и blood here и there, и that the fluffy tail feathers have fallen out miserably. *No matter how far Центория is, Я could never imagine it would be like this just by running through meadows и fields. Цукигаке surely made a hard work guiding Кирито here.*

As she gently stroked the little dragon who was chirping “ku~, ku~”, they heard a shrill chirp from the Восточной side of the forest.

Light-blue fur ball jumped out of bushes и rushed to them. When it reached the floor surface by slipping through the remains of the mansion piled up in the front yard, it crashed into Тейза.

"Шимосаки!!"

— Тейза also shouted, firmly holding the love dragon. Next to her, Асуна said with a gentle smile:

"Without Шимосаки’s chirping и the brilliance of light elements glimmering through the window of the mansion, we wouldn’t have noticed this place. Everyone did a good job here."

"…………Yes……"

— Тейза answered with the wet voice, Шимосаки chirped proudly at her chest "Ку-ру-ру!" Цукигаке answered "Кю-ру-ру!" In addition, "Кю-kyu!" — a third cry echoed.

"............!?"

In response to several surprised looks trying to find a source of the voice, a much smaller creature, a little smaller than the young dragons, came out of Кирито's coat, ran up и sat down on his head. A brown bВосточной with profusely long ears, something between a rabbit и a rat, look around at everyone и as if complaining of something again cried "Kyu!!!".

".......K-Кирито-сенпай, what is that thing?"

When she asked in surprise, Кирито turned his eyes towards the rat on his head и said:

"Well, that is....... When we flew above the field in the Южной part of former private territories, Цукигаке was fighting a bВосточной named something like anaguma......."

"Я guess, that's not ‘anaguma’ but ‘hanaguma’."

After answering "As if it makes any difference......"<sup><a href="#Prim10">10</a></sup> to Асуна's point, he shook his head и continued the explanation.

"Anyway, after we chased away those hanagumas, treated Цукигаке's injuries и were about to fly again to the lake, Цукигаке ran to a **bucket**, a wooden cane that was rolling near...... this guy came out of it."

"From the cane, is it...?"

"Yup, from the situation, it seemed that Цукигаке hid it in the cane before fighting hanagumas. So, Я thought it would be an important **flag**, a condition to fulfill, but it did not do anything in particular..."

When Премьер-Мечник finished, Цукигаке chirped "Ку-ру-ру~..." while moving his glance between Ронье и Кирито, и the rat responded "Кю-Кю-kyu!"

Ронье did not precisely understand the meaning of Цукигаке's chirping as well as rat’s squeaking. Still, she somehow perceived the overall sense of the interaction и tried to express it into Мира Людей language:

"W-well... apparently, Цукигаке seems to have promised that mouse... something ..."

"Promised......?"

When Кирито, Асуна и Тейза exchanged looks altogether, the rat complainingly jumped on Премьер-Мечник's head. The situation was so strange that called for a smile ─

That moment.

A blood-red flash burst on the floor slightly away.

"Kii!!!"

— the rat screamed и jumped into Кирито's bosom. Цукигаке и Шимосаки also made warning sounds.

Ронье looked at the source while shielding the eyes with her right hand from the stabbing light.

What was shining was a gem that laid on the floor. The necklace Император Крюгер и Император Hozaica wore on the chest.

"Сенпай! That is the culprit of everything!"

That moment when Ронье shouted и Кирито took a step towards a red flash.

The gem rose into the sky with terrible momentum.

Кирито stretched his right hand to the red light rising fast enough to exceed the flame arrows art. The shining rapidly decelerated и stopped about 30 mel above.

Кирито was trying to grasp it with the "arm of mind".

*It cannot shake off Кирито's mind – capable to fly a metal dragon.* Ронье thought so, but the gem had not fallen easily. It trembled as if being pulled behind with a chain, but remained at the same point in the sky.

The battle lasted for about 3 seconds.

Suddenly, **bakin!** — impact-like sound echoed.

The chain that it was pulled with by the power of mind seemed to break apart.

And the gem continued to rise steadily as if it was released from the hold, until it melted in the bright red sunset и disappeared. Then, as it passed through places high enough to have some clouds, the trajectory of the red light could be defined. That light pointed to the side where Solus sank...... in the direction of the Западной Империи Wesdarath.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>Yes, this time it’s definitely “she”. Цукигаке is female. Я wonder how many hours it will take me to fix all the references to the dragon in both books… (the answer is: 2.5 hours) Please don't tell me Орои too is female...
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Before doing that Я guess she swapped the Меч to the right one.
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>If you are confused just like Ронье is, [Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamberlain_(office)).
3. <a name="Prim4"></a>Original reads "disk" (円盤). However, this is probably editors' miss because all the way ahead, similar object is referred to as "ring" (指輪) и it is mentioned that it is a piece of jewelry.
4. <a name="Prim5"></a>[Numa-unagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inshore_hagfish).
5. <a name="Prim6"></a>Я have doublechecked several times, и a) yes that’s the first time Я hear about that и b) no there is no word “innocent” or alike in the phrase, и c) yes that makes the scene in the guards' building from the volume 19 completely impossible.
6. <a name="Prim7"></a>[Katashiro](http://yokai.com/katashiro/).
7. <a name="Prim8"></a>These numbers, despite expectation, were written with kanji, e.g. 三千. Don't know the reason, but it’s just strange because usually all numbers related to Stacia’s window in these books are written using Западной notation, e.g. 3000.
8. <a name="Prim9"></a>Я slightly simplified here, original refers to a “divine beast” (essentially, [this](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/瑞獣)), as well as to “divine bird”( 神鳥). Given that term “divine beast” for sure covers some birds, I’ve no idea what Ронье means here.
10. <a name="Prim10"></a>It does make some difference, though. Anaguma (穴熊) means “badger”, и despite certain similarities, it is entirely different animal, и should Цукигаке actually meat Underworld “anaguma”, this book would have a touchy scene at the cemetery.
