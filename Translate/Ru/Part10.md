"Тейза-сан, Ронье-сан. How is your injuries’ condition?"

When Вице-Премьер-Мечник asked, they nodded at the same time.

"Yes, we’ve completely healed."

— when Ронье answered that,

"Кирито-сенпай’d call that ‘hyakupa recovery’!"

— Тейза also showed a clenched fist.

*Я do not know the meaning of the sacred word ‘hyakupa’<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, but it seems to be familiar to Асуна, as she smiled gently.*

"Yes, I'm glad. ...... This time we’ve got you two into some really painful experience.... "

Ронье и Тейза frantically shook heads towards Асуна, who moved down the long eyelashes as her smile disappeared:

"No, it’s all only because we went into such a dangerous place..."

"And thanks to Асуна-сама giving her good word, clerics director Ayuha treated us well. Look, it’s all right."

As she said so, Тейза lifted the jacket и underwear together, demonstrating her belly. Severe scratches left by deeply penetrating fusion-type minion's nails were completely healed, и no traces were left.

That's fine, but no matter how few people were in the Собора’s ninety-fifth floor, the "Наблюдательный пост Утренней Звезды", it was a little inappropriate for a girl to show her belly. Stretching a hand и pulling Тейза's clothes down, the other one said:

"Even so, Ayuha-сама's knowledge of components is tremendous...... We intended to study them quite seriously in the academy too, but she called out plants и minerals that have never even heard of before one after another, Я was quite surprised."

"Even after Ayuha-сан took the position of the Sacred Art division chief, she seems to go searching for a new kind of medicinal herbs on the seventh day. Her little sister Sones was complaining that those give medicine an odd taste."

— whispered Асуна и continued, smiling again:

"Anyway, Ayuha-сан since her childhood wanted to become a doctor и it seems her plant research passion has rekindled after listening to the story that Кирито-kun managed to make Zefiria flower blooming in Northern Центория."

"Ah...... It is not advisable to compete against the work of Кирито-сенпай...."

when Ронье Unintentionally said so, Тейза cheerfully laughed. Цукигаке и Шимосаки who were eating dried fish on the floor also chirped "ku-ru-ru”; next to them, their new friend, miminaga-nure-nezumi, named Nuts<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, was crunching a deliciously looking nut.

Three days have passed since the incident in Император's domain, it was February 27th. On the 30th, the festival commemorating the anniversary of rebellion against the four Императорs was planned to be held extensively in the whole city of Центория, и the Собора was a little more crowded than usual.

But for the Union Council people, it was totally not a time to slack off.

Император Hozaica Eastabarieth of the Eastern Empire и Император Крюгер Норлангарт of the Northern Empire, who should have been eliminated a year ago, were revived in minion bodies и became deeply involved in a series of incidents. Especially, Император Крюгер who was hiding in the territory directly beside the center capital Центория и was about to proceed with mass production plan of fusion-type minions which are much stronger than the prototype; Фанатио и Дюсольберт, as well as director of intelligence Xiao Shukas, received a deep shock when learned about it.

In response to the incident, the imperial territory of the four empires и private territories were searched all over again, but there were no discoveries of any hidden property of senior aristocrats leading to the conspiracy. What was most searched was the red gem that flew away from the Император's villa to the western sky, but for the moment there were no results there, too. Since the object was jewelry not even of a human’s but only about of a bird’s egg size, it seems knights Fizel и Linel which were leading the search in the Western empire, were also struggling.

Another artifact remaining after Император Крюгер, the ring with the imperial house emblem, was jointly analyzed by Ayuha и Sones, the two greatest clerics in the Собора. There was no doubt that the secret of resurrection was hidden in that ring which the Император called "katashiro", but *it is a hundred times harder to extrapolate the art synopsis given only an object used as an art medium......* that’s what Sones said.

In other words, almost all threads leading to the conspiracy mastermind were broken. Speaking of other things, both the pair of a large и a small knife used by great chamberlain Зеппос и the clay bags stacked in large quantities on the villa's premises, were unlikely to lead to new clues.

The Объединённого Совета Мира Людей has decided to invite senior dark arts masters from Тёмной Территории to consult regarding clay и ring investigation, и the horse messenger was already sent to Obsidia castle. But it will take twelve days for a personal letter to reach general commander Isukan, и even if the invitation is fulfilled at all given the circumstances, it will take another two weeks for the reply to arrive from the other side.

On the other hand, Ронье и Тейза, after getting scolded by knights leader Фанатио for not returning with the report as soon as they heard a sound from the villa, as a result of their great contribution to the discovery и rescue of the abducted mountain гоблинов, were told they would be promoted from the apprentice knights to the lower rank Рыцарь Целостностиs.

Formal appointment was scheduled to be in early March after the Liberation Memorial Festival, but they were already given the hint on knight numbers.

Following the knight Eldrie Синтез Thirty-One who died a noble death at the time of Войны с Внешним Миром, Тейза was given the number 32. и Ронье got 33.

According to the tradition of Рыцарь Целостностиs, they both would have to throw away their family names, but "**Синтез**" is a sacred word meaning "a person who received the Синтез ritual", so after discussion with Кирито и Асуна, the two who were not synthesized, were left to only add the number to their names. This way, the knights Тейза Shtolienen Thirty-Two и Ронье Arabel Thirty-Three were born.

After fighting with the Император и Зеппос, the equipment control authority of the two rose to 40, which would be totally insufficient for a member of the Order, but Ронье did not feel that they are going to be regular knights anyway.

Perhaps, it was because of this she has not yet discussed the matter with Тейза since receiving an informal promotion two days ago.

Ронье several times invited her to talk, but each time Тейза said "Sorry, I’m still not......" и turned the eyes down. As for the reasons of why she did not want to talk about promotion, Ронье had a dim idea.

Perhaps, Тейза was thinking to settle two things before promoting to a regular knight.

One was the marriage to the knight Renri.

Another one was her feelings to deceased Юдзио.

Originally, they came close to the sealed Император's villa to investigate the rumors of ghosts lurking there. Come to think of it now, the inhabitants were taken for ghosts, or somebody noticed Зеппос digging up the forest soil.

But Тейза surely wanted the villa to be haunted ── the ghosts to be real. If the dead can really come to life again, she thought that she might meet Юдзио again.

There were no ghosts in the Император's villa.

But after that fight, Тейза's hesitancy must have deepened.

The Император и Зеппос are the dead men who were revived using "katashiro" и minion manufacturing techniques. Which means that if one uses the same method, Юдзио can also be resurrected.

Of course, Юдзио himself wouldn’t want to come back to life by getting minion body. But even without her telling this, it was easy to understand Тейза’s painful feelings...... she would like to just exchange words with him, to meet him once again.

Her thoughts about Юдзио did not disappear и postponed the reply to Renri, so an early promotion to a regular knight may had set a deadline for Тейза. Besides, Ронье knew that despite being cheerful as usual during the daytime, at midnights she cried alone in her room.

She wanted to give support. To ease the suffering even a little. But Ронье could not do anything.

Асуна planned a tea ceremony when she noticed the sad face that Тейза occasionally showed. The light of Solus gently poured down to the Lookout of Morning Star with its four sides open to the sky, blowing through with a breeze giving a pleasant sensing of long-awaited spring. Aromatic apple tea from chef Hana’s secret stock, as well as the apple pie Асуна baked, were very tasty; a smile would come naturally when one saw three girls who are eating a snack.

However, the grief living in the depths of autumn leaves-colored eyes of Тейза who seemed to laugh cheerfully did not go away.

*If it keeps like this, maybe Тейза refuses the promotion to a regular knight.  
On the contrary, she’d return the Меч и the knights’ emblem и leave the Центрального Собора......*

Trapped by such a feeling, Ронье shortly sighed, when…

"Sorry, I’m late!"

— Кирито said this running up the stairs.

Suddenly Асуна stood up, hands on her hips.

"It's really late. We've already finished eating pie."

"Eh...... s-so my share...?"

"Not sure if anything’s left—"

"Ah, no way you—!"

After their usual exchange, Кирито put a long package he held in his left hand on the flowerbed nearby, и sat in a chair between Ронье и Асуна.

Of course, Асуна left a piece of pie for him, cut it и placed together with an apple tea in front of Кирито. Тейза asked Кирито who opened mouth wide и began working on it.

"So, Кирито-сенпай, you said you’ll be late ‘cause of work, where did you go?"

"Om-nom-nom...... I’ve been called by Deus-сан....... He said that he wants to strengthen the security system of the festival on the thirtieth."

Ронье decided to ignore the too familiar nickname he gave to instructor Дюсольберт, и instead asked:

"Is it because the black Императорs’ henchmen might set up on the festival... something?"

"B-black Императорs?"

Since Кирито и Асуна exchanged looks, Ронье explained after looking at Тейза’s face:

"See, we do not seem to have an official name for those who have caused the series of incidents, so we call it like this..."

"Indeed, the black Императорs’ henchmen...... Well, good, I'll call them this way as well....... Yes, it is exactly what Deus-сан is worried about, but Я think the possibility is low. The goal of the revived Императорs was to start war again between Мира Людей и Тёмной Территории, и the fusion-type minions prepared for that purpose were destroyed. Even if they are still aiming at the same, it’s going to take a while for them to prepare..."

"So...... In other words, if Тейза и Ронье did not uncover Император Крюгер’s retreat, that fusion-type minions would have been attacking the liberation festival."

Кирито deeply nodded to Асуна's words:

"That's right. Фанатио-сан was getting angry with you earlier, but this time you two really helped us. After all, we have found more than two hundred bags of clay in the forest...... I’m horrified to think that all that could become new minions."

"In that case, what did they intend to put into the basic bodies...?"

When Тейза asked, Кирито groaned after drinking a gulp of apple tea.

"Hmm.... It is not realistic for them to kidnap all sub-humans who are currently staying in Мира Людей, actually. The exchange project has been temporarily suspended, tourists are steadily returning home....... Oh yeah, Орои и the other three mountain гоблинов will leave tomorrow morning. They wanted to thank Ронье и you."

"Yes, of course Я will go see them off!"

Having instantly answered, Ронье looked at the eastern sky.

The Великих Восточных Врат, which had been keeping Мира Людей и Тёмной Территории apart for more than four hundred years, collapsed in order to contest the two worlds one year и three months ago. After the end of the war, the Gate was rebuilt, but the wooden door remained open all the way.

But after the old Yazen was killed, the door was closed again. In that sense, the black Императорs’ conspiracy has already had certain effects. Besides, the incident had not been solved at all.

Recalling what she heard from knight Fizel in the large public bath, Ронье returned her gaze to the profile of Премьер-Мечник:

"Oh, Кирито-сенпай. It was only the Император of the Western Empire, Ardales Wesdarath V, whose corpse wasn’t found... wasn’t he?"

"Yeah, Я heard that. The Western Центория Imperial Palace was burned to the ground by Фанатио-сан’s memory liberation technique...... It took them three months to remove the rubble, so even if the corpse of Император Ardales was buried there, by the time they reached insides of the castle, it should have dissolved to sacred power long time ago."

"Or he could have escaped и is hiding somewhere... no?"

When Асуна pointed that out, Кирито muttered with his arms folded:

"Well..... Император Крюгер was able to hide in the villa Я think because of the minion body did not have to eat anything. But if Император Ardales is alive, he’d need food. и if he goes shopping, he would absolutely be looking suspicious и will be caught in Xiao's information network.…… However……"

"However, what?"

"According to Fizel и Linel's investigation, there were several former disseminated Western Empire Konoe knights order и whose current location cannot be confirmed. If they swore loyalty to the Император, Я don’t think it’d be possible to quickly move to Мира Людей Defense Army..."

"If the former knights joined the Император, it would not be difficult to get food, you may need to expand the scope of the search if it is the case."

"No matter how many hands there are, it is never enough."

Ронье knew that Кирито said so because he himself was chased by a lot of work every day. Unconsciously, she stretched the spine и said in a formal voice:

"Well, when Я become a regular knight, Я will try helping you more!"

Кирито looked at Ронье и smiled "I'm counting on you", then moved his eyes to Тейза, и opened his eyes wide in a startle.

Ронье also looked to the right.

Тейза, who was listening to the subject with a serious expression until just before, was sitting there, head down, biting her lips as if desperately trying to endure the tears.

"Тейза."

She reflexively reached the hand out и touched her best friend's back. *Тейза is supposed to be a little bigger than me now, but it feels like she is as small as a child.*

Both Кирито и Асуна did not say anything. Resolve was supposed to be the characteristic of the Order’s member, however, sincerely caring of Тейза’s feelings, they remained silent.

"Kyu-ru......"

Шимосаки, who was chasing with Цукигаке и Nuts around the middle of the garden, shortly chirped, came close to the table и licked Тейза's right hand fingers. Тейза slowly raised her face after gently plucking the neck of the young dragon with her hand.

"Um......, Кирито-сенпай, Асуна-сама......."

When the two silently nodded, Тейза said, pushing out one word at a time through clenched teeth:

"....... Я am thinking of declining to be promoted to a regular knight."

"Why is that?"

— Кирито asked bluntly looking straight at her. From the time they first met in Академии Искусства Меча, they knew this feeling of being inquired by a gaze of his black eyes, his gentle but powerful look, и Тейза finally pushed out what she had in my mind for a long time:

"...... Я attempted to examine the Император's villa...... because Я have heard rumors that there is a ghost there. Should a ghost exist...... Я wondered if Я could meet Юдзио-сенпай someday again. Я rushed ahead и endangered Ронье, Цукигаке и Шимосаки only because of my personal interest. Я do not have the right...... I’m not eligible to become a regular knight."

At the last words she violently shook, closed her mouth, и grains of tears ran out of her autumn leaves-colored eyes.

Ронье had a lot to tell to her best friend, but now it was Кирито's task to comfort Тейза’s thoughts.

"... If Я could meet him too............"

Кирито said in a gentle, but somewhat distant voice. Тейза snapped her face up, и stared at Кирито with wet eyes.

"Me too, from time to time feel that overwhelming desire to see Юдзио и to talk to him again. Being alone, Я imperceptibly recollect his words и smile. и you know...... it wouldn’t be true if Я say that in this world there is no way to hear the voice of the person who passed away. The memory of a person soaks into things that he cherished or places he liked, и from there it is not impossible to extract a pseudo-soul with some Sacred Art..."

When Кирито said so, Тейза shivered with the whole body. She grasped both hands in front of the chest и asked squeezing words out:

"Then...... then you can meet him? Once again, Юдзио-сенпай..."

Then Кирито closed the eyes for a moment и slowly shook his head:

"...... Even if Я can hear Юдзио's voice because of some form of an art, it cannot be said that it would be the real Юдзио. Just like Император Крюгер who revived as a minion was not the real Император....... Five floors above this place, on the top floor of the Собора, Юдзио died by the hand of the Первосвященник while attacking her. His soul, along with the Алиса’s soul consisting of her childhood memories taken away during the Синтез ritual, are now gone. After that Юдзио’s memory stayed in the Меч which helped me a number of times, but... in the battle with Император Vector, it finally burned out......"

Кирито's words were comforting but cruel at the same time. Тейза slowly dropped her shoulders и muttered:

"Well... then, there are no memories of Сенпай left anywhere in this world..."

"No, it’s not like this."

— While saying so resolutely, Кирито lifted his right hand и pressed it against his chest:

"Memories are here. In minds of all the people who met Юдзио и spent time together with him, the memory of him remains. If this memory of Юдзио speaks...... that is the real Юдзио."

Тейза, who quietly breathed in, put her right hand on her chest in the same way.

But after a few seconds her hands fell down to the knees.

"............ I...... Я only had about a month around Юдзио-сенпай. Я could not travel together with him like Кирито-сенпай did, nor could we fight together in the Axiom Church. Moreover...... it was basically because of me that Юдзио-сенпай was taken to the Church. My Сенпай left the academy и now is gone....... Я cannot hear Юдзио-сенпай’s voice..."

Having said so, Тейза pushed both hands against her face и began to cry; Шимосаки rubbed his neck against her leg while raising an anxious voice. Цукигаке и Nuts also watched the situation side by side.

"....... Тейза-сан."

As Тейза continued to cry, Асуна talk to her in a calm voice.

"Я have also lost an important person in the Real World. She was younger than me, but she had always been strong, always smiling brightly и said she was my little sister. The time we spent together was very short, but.... but at the time of Войны с Внешним Миром, she helped me. Even now, Я have lot of memories of this girl. What is important is not the length of time... besides, since Юдзио-сан acted to help Тейза-сан и others, he must have never had any regrets about it."

Асуна finished talking и extended the left hand gently stroking Тейза’s back, her crying little by little stopped.

Still, Кирито said to Тейза who did not try to remove her hands from the face:

"Тейза. Even if you decline the promotion to a regular knight, are you going to swap the Меч?"

Although it was a sudden question, after a while Тейза finally took off her hand from the face и nodded.

"...... Yes, back there at the villa, Я made Ронье to fight because Я still used the regular Меч..."

"Then, on top of selecting a Меч in the armor store...... Я would like you to keep this one."

That said, Кирито lifted the cloth-wrapped package from the flower bed nearby.

What came out from the white cloth was a beautiful single-handed long Меч with a rose embossed on an ice-like transparent guard. As soon as she saw it, Тейза opens the eyes wide:

"S-Меч Синей Розы...?!"

The Меч Кирито put in the middle of the table was definitely the Меч Синей Розы — the former Юдзио’s beloved Меч и after his death was the finest divine object that Кирито continued to own.

"B-but, this is… Кирито-сенпай’s......."

Тейза was just slightly shaking her head. Ронье could also understand the inexpressible feeling that she experienced.

Кирито had shut his heart since fighting the Первосвященник till the end of the Войны с Внешним Миром, и for a long time could not speak or walk, but he never let go of the Меч Ночного Неба и the Меч Синей Розы. But Кирито smiled и said with a voice full of a strong will:

"I'd like you to have this one, Тейза, now you still are not strong enough to equip it и it will be difficult to swing,...... but at least you can take care of it. If you carefully polish it, one day Тейза for sure will be able to hear Юдзио's voice. That voice will be absolutely not a fake. Not the one extracted with an art, but the voice produced from within the memories....... here you go."

Encouraged by Кирито, Тейза steadily extended her hands и grasped the long Меч contained in the white leather sheath.

The current Тейза's weapon equipment authority was the same as Ронье’s, 40. On the other hand, the priority of the Меч Синей Розы should have been 45. If the numbers differ by five, it is usually difficult to lift it as long as the person is not granted the sacred task of a blacksmith or a craftsman.

Since Юдзио и Кирито entered the Академии Искусства Меча, they could freely handle this Меч, a divine object. That means that their weapon equipment authority has reached 45, the level of highest grades. Considering that, one can also talk about the fact that the two had equalized with Дюсольберт и Фанатио и others in Центрального Собора, but, as Кирито constantly said, the strength cannot be represented only by figures.

Тейза stood up placing her legs wide enough to remain steady и let out a long breath. Then, same way slowly breathed in, held her breath ─ и carefully little by little lifted the Меч Синей Розы.

The divine object resonated with Тейза’s spirit, did not refuse her hands. Firmly holding the Меч with both hands, Тейза gently gripped the handle, и a small smile appeared on her face instead of drying tears.

"....... Кирито Сенпай, Я will do my best to take care of the Меч Синей Розы. Я will polish it every day и practice my training more seriously... и someday, I’ll become a strong senior knight able to swing this Меч!"

"……Uhu."

— Кирито и Асуна nodded at the same time, и Ронье blinked to shake off the tear blurring the vision.

*Her thoughts on Юдзио и the proposal from Renri. Looks like, it will take some time for Тейза to answer. But little by little... going forward one step at a time. As the two of us have done so far.*

A gentle breeze passed through the garden, и the 2 o'clock bell rang lightly.

"Oops... it's just about the time."

— Кирито suddenly murmured и swallowed the piece of an apple pie that remained in the dish in one bite. As Кирито, looking pretty similar to a tree nut lover Nuts with his swollen cheeks, was chewing it down, Асуна asked him:

"The time for what?"

"Everyone, please take a look at the main gate."

They moved along the aisle as he said ─ Тейза still holding the divine object which appeared to be truly physically heavy though,─ и looked over the front garden of Собора from the southern side.

That time the gate, normally closed, opened wide, и large four-horse carriage came in through it.

"Wow, such a big horse carriage..."

— Тейза muttered, и Ронье also tilted her head:

"Who is inside...?"

"Hey, don’t you remember the report you heard at a meeting couple of days ago?"

— Кирито said smiling with cream on his face.

"The Sacred Art masters apprentices entering the tower this month."

"Eh…………!"

Ронье looked at Тейза и then at the carriage again.

*There certainly was something like this on the agenda. Я had completely forgotten it because of the troubles caused by the black Императорs, but that means that in the carriage......*

"....... Frenica!"

— Ронье и Тейза shouted out loudly и looked at the faces of Кирито и Асуна.

"Oh, hey, Сенпай, we..."

"Ah, are you going to welcome her? Я will deliver the Меч Синей Розы to your room later then."

"S-sorry, Я would appreciate your favor!"

Actually, she did not want to let it go so quickly, but she wouldn’t be able to run with a divine object. Тейза retuned the Меч to Кирито и quickly lowered her head:

"Асуна-сама, thank you for the pie и tea party! Would you kindly excuse us!"

"Welcome."

— smiling Асуна waved them a hand, и the two rushed to the staircase, when they heard ─

"So, I’ll go too, will welcome Selka."

— a voice from behind. Turning around in surprise, Ронье saw Кирито holding the Меч Синей Розы in his right hand, about to jump from the platform straight to the air.

"Ah, hey Кирито-kun, please take me along!"

— shouted Асуна, leaping at him from behind и falling together with him outside. Премьер-Мечник и Вице-Премьер-Мечник disappeared in a blink of an eye, и when Ронье again looked back at Тейза, she grinned.

"Hey Цукигаке, Шимосаки, Nuts, let’s go!"

When she turned back и called, the young dragons answered "Ku-ru-ru!" и the rat jumped on Цукигаке’s back.

The two people и three animals began running cheerfully down from the Lookout where early spring flowers bloomed.

(the end)




## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>This is a combination of “hyaku” (one hundred) и “pa~”, first syllable of “pa~sento” (percent). So it’s a Japanese slang word consisting of a Japanese word, treated as a non-Japanese one, plus a syllable of another non-Japanese word, all in all, meaning “100%”. Good luck trying to adapt this… best thing Я came up with was “damgud” but it’s so pitiful it only deserves a place in a footnote.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Actually, it's "Natsu" (ナツ). But it's definitely not because of Summer (natsu, 夏), nor because of a Fairy Tail reference. Something tells me that it's simply because the rat wanted nuts. Besides, given _who_ gave the name, Я see no other choice but to adapt it.
