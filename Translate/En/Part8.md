Before establishing the Human World calendar, that is, more than 380 years in the past of Human World history, there were moving objects called "divine animals".

Silverwhite snake which lived in a deep mountain valley in the Eastern Empire. A phoenix that nested in a volcano in the Southern Empire. Giant ice dragon which protected the mountain range of the Northern Empire. A winged lion which used to rush the grassland of the Western Empire, and so on.

Their number was more than 40, but they had no fluctlight, it was an advanced AI program able to communicate with Human World people using the dedicated speech engine. People feared and respected divine beasts as gods on earth, and left many legends.

However, for a girl who established the Axiom church in the year 30 of Human World calendar and then ruled the Human World by the name of Highest Priest Administrator, "gods" other than the gods that appeared in the ecclesiastical history were disturbing beings. She was getting rid of them either herself, making weapons — divine objects — out of them, or letting her subordinate Integrity Knights do the extermination job. Then, around the year 100 of Human World calendar, all the divine beasts were destroyed, and all the books that wrote about the exchange with them were burned away.

None of birds and animals inhabiting the present Human World were able to use human language. However, there was only one kind among them, beasts which preserved AI to a very limited extent. Those were the Integrity Knights’ partners, dragons.

The dragons, even if they could not speak human language, were able to understand even a fairly complicated command given to the owner. And they also had "heart" used to strengthen the bonds with the owner.

Therefore, young dragon Tsukigake, raised by the Integrity Knight apprentice Ronye Arabel, rushed hard to carry out the command of his owner: "Go along this aisle to the ground and get to the north gate of Centoria."

***

After he climbed up a stairway of sixty steps while fluttering small wings and got out pushing the body through the gap in the iron grid, Tsukigake looked around.

There was just a metal grate on behind, both the right and left were blocked by a thorny hedge, and the only available path extended ahead. But Tsukigake did not like the idea of going forward. Because there was a mansion with a bad presence down the path. While approaching there, it might be found by black people who captured brother dragon Shimosaki in the basement. He was not scared of those folks, but if they would catch him there was a chance he won’t be able to serve the master.

He turned to the right and looked up at the top of a hedge. Tried to jump over a hedge that seemed to be higher than his owner while swiftly fluttering small wings, but did not reach the top at all. Still he tried hard for a few seconds, but the wings soon got tired and he fell on the butt to the stone pavement. After bouncing two or three times like temari<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, he finally got the strained body up.

If that’s the case, there is no choice but to break through the hedge.

"Ku-ru-ru..."

After softly chirping to demonstrate the readiness, he folded the wings tightly and thrust the nose into the surface by the roots of the hedge.

Most shrubs have spaces near their roots, but this plant had branches extending to the immediate vicinity of the ground, and the branches also bore countless sharp 3 centimeters long thorns. He tried to crawl down the ground to the limit, and in this pose to pass through a small gap, but the moment a thorn hit his neck, sharp pain run through the whole body.

Having turned his head back, Tsukigake bit it with his tiny fangs and kept moving forward. Painful spots emerged one after another on the soft feathery back, scratching the scaleless skin. Although due to the pain from time to time his mouth involuntarily leaked "Kyuuu......", he pushed on.

It took him more than one minute to get through a hedge that was less than 50 cens thick. Finally released from thorns, Tsukigake threw his body in wet fallen leaves and tried to catch his breath.

As soon as pain somewhat let him go, he bent long neck carefully and looked over the back. The prideful yellow feathers were messy and stained red with running blood.

Tsukigake did not understand a Life’s numerical value, but it was clear to him that living creature will die if blood continues to run out. He straightened the disturbed feathers with his nose and licked each scratch one by one. Dragon saliva had a weak healing effect, and bleeding stops when the wound is licked several times, but his tongue did not reach the furthermost scratches on the back.

The pain finally faded to the extent that he could deal with, so Tsukigake shook the body shaking off mud and fallen leaves and stood up with only the hind legs.

A deep forest spread ahead. The yellow sunlight obstructed by the branches and leaves of the coniferous trees hardly reached the ground, but the direction could be understood.

*The big city of humans which Master Ronye calls "Centoria" is in the south. This forest is the place to come for the first time and I do not know the distance well as I got here on a carriage from the city, but I have to arrive as soon as possible.*

*Fortunately, I ate plenty of fish from the lake a few hours ago so my stomach is not empty yet. I did not like the smell of the dead fish given in the stables for the past few months, and I did not eat much of it, but it was fun to catch the fish swimming in the water by myself and it was very tasty because it was fresh. I feel that remembering the taste will only make me hungry, so better to forget about fish and start running on the forest sole with all four legs.*

Unlike the garden of "Cathedral" where Tsukigake lived or the grassland around the lake, the damp sole of the forest was slippery and stones and roots hidden under the fallen leaves made it difficult to run. Every time tipping over an obstacle, he felt and roll, but still kept going south on and on.

Running around a thick tree, Tsukigake's keen nose caught something smelly, some rotten smell.

A part of the ground surrounded by winding trees was dug out almost entirely. The black soil was cold, damp and sticky, unlike the soft soil of the flowerbed in the front of the Cathedral garden. The odor seemed to drift from the big hole, but even after inspecting the pit closely he couldn’t see anything at the bottom.

"Ku-ru……"

Tsukigake slowly moved away from the edge of the hole. It was unclear if he can escape if he falls, nor had he time to loiter having a snack at that time.

After getting around the badly smelling pit and running for a few more minutes it started to get brighter little by little. The exit of the forest was near. Tsukigake jumped from between the two old trees, kicking hard of the ground with his wings flapping while running through the last ten mel.

Grassland surrounding the forest had been dyed in bright yellow, illuminated in the light of sun bending to the sunset. After running for a while sucking cold but fresh air, he stopped at the top of the hill.

Looking around, he saw a white wall across the meadow on the right side, a water surface of the glittering lake on the left side, and a small human town in the front.* It is farther than I thought, but if I run hard, I will be able to arrive sooner or later. No, “sooner or later” won’t work. At this very moment, my Master and her best friend are trapped in the dungeon, and Shimosaki is taken to the mansion, and he must have been scared so much.*

"Kyu-ru-ru!"

Tsukigake began to run again after quietly chirping, so that black people would not be hear by any chance.

Although it was somewhat better than in the forest, the grass around here was also tall and tried to push the small body back. Running with the neck stretched up, he thrust the grass with the front legs to make path.

After about five minutes passed, this time he felt clear hunger. Even a child of a dragon, to maintain Life level, requires much more food than dogs and foxes of the same size.

A large lake was shining gold in about a hundred mels to the left. There would be plenty of tasty fish swimming in the water. Just one this thought made him slightly shift the track to the left, but Tsukigake shook his head as he ran and returned to the previous direction. *I will not die because of being hungry, but my Master’s life is in danger.*

If the memory of what he had seen from the window of the horse-drawn carriage was correct, there should have been a large abandoned field on the south side of the grassland surrounding the lake. If it's indeed there, it will be possible to find at least one shriveled potato. Only that hope supported the spirit as he ran for five minutes, and then.

Suddenly his foreleg sunk into the ground, so Tsukigake fell somersault and rolled. After several turns the rolling finally stopping, the back touching the ground felt submerging in cold water. Sharp pain echoed from fresh wounds where blood has just stopped, thin cry leaked from the back of the throat.

However, it wasn’t possible lying down forever. The area was a wetland covering the vast grounds produced with water flowing out of the lake. Tsukigake, born in Cathedral, has never entered wetlands before, but there was an instinctive knowledge that if you are immersed in cold water for long, the Life will decrease faster. Reanimating the body, he stretched and turned the neck carefully around to check the surroundings again.

His front and left were blocked by wide wetlands, the dry ground was only on the right side. However, it was completely unknown how far the wetlands extend. If wetlands continue all the way to the white wall visible in that direction, a lot of time will be wasted.

"Ku-ru-ru..."

Tsukigake who had no idea what to do next inadvertently leaked a miserable voice.

Then, as if hearing his voice, a small creature came out from a grassy place a little away, and shrilly chirped "Kyu-kyu?!".

A creature with short brown fur, ears almost as long as the body, and small round eyes, looked up at Tsukigake, turning the neck to the right as if saying ‘what the heck is this thing’.

Tsukigake thought exactly the same thing. The creature that was about thirty cen long from a pointed tip of the nose to a short tail was called "Miminaga-nure-nezumi"<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> by the people of the central city, but of course Tsukigake did not know such a thing.

Looking over the elliptical body of the brown mouse having no boundary between the neck and the torso, he thought it would be delicious to catch it and eat it. The rat tried to quickly withdraw into the grass as if feeling Tsukigake's appetite, so it’s opponent quickly hurriedly objected:

"Kuru!!!"

Whether or not Tsukigake was able to communicate a request to wait ─ nobody can say for sure, but the rat stopped running away leaving the long nose where a beard grew sticking out. After two seconds, it fearfully shoved out the whole head.

*If I scare it again — it will run away at once.* Tsukigake lowered his body as low as possible and squeaked in low voice pretending that he is not going to eat it.

"Ru-ru-ru-ru......"

This time the mouse tilted its head to the left and slowly moved the body out of the grass.

If you look closely, the tips of elongated limbs had swim fins. It was surely a creature living on this land for a long time. Then it might know the way through the swamp.

"Kyu-ru, Kyu-ru-ru-run."

*── I want to go to the South. Tell me if you knew the way.*

Although it was not possible to put the intention into a verbal form, the rat quickly moved long ears and answered "Kyu" to Tsukigake's chirping filled with desperate emotions.

Tsukigake, who felt an echo of ‘I’m hungry’ in the sound, immediately answered:

*── Show me the way, will get you delicious fish as much as you like.*

*── Do not need fish. I like tree nuts.*

*── But there are no trees here.*

While Tsukigake spoke, a small dark object floated on the water surface between the two animals. Rat cried "Ki!!!", jumped in the water, and lifted it with both hands.

From the look of it, it was certainly a nut. Perhaps, the tree nuts that fell to the lake from the trees growing on its banks would flow over time to wetlands. Rat immediately brought the precious thing to the mouth with both hands, but even though it had long front teeth, there was no crunchy sound but only sound of damp and moist. *Meanwhile, as I stand immersed in water, my Life runs out.*

"Ku-ru-ru-ru, kyu-ru!!!"

*── If you guide me, I will give you a lot of fresh nuts. Not damp, crunchy ones.*

"Kyuu......."

*── Really? You ought to find one in a whole year.*

*── I promise. You can eat as much as you want everyday.*

*── Well, then. Come.*

Tsukigake wasn’t sure whether the exchange actually took place this way. But after the rat finished eating a black tree nut, it moved to a dry ground nearby and jumped into the grass with excitement.

Tsukigake also hurriedly jumped over the water and thrusted his neck in the place where the mouse disappeared. There was a tunnel of about 30 cen in diameter extending in the densely grown grass. Walls of firmly woven dry grass were clearly not made by nature.

The mouse stopped close to an entrance to the tunnel and waved a short tail as if calling for him to hurry. Tsukigake was slightly bigger than its width and height, so had to shrink a bit, but not as much as to get through the gap in the iron grid that was in the dungeon, besides, the dry grass spread all over the floor helped, too.

"Ku-ru-ru!!!"

After chirping in a loud voice to inspire himself, Tsukigake started running in a narrow and dark tunnel. The mouse also faced ahead and moved as if sliding while moving short legs only a little.

In just three mels ahead the tunnel was diverging to the left and right. Rat jumped into the left aisle without slowing down, so Tsukigake followed. Immediately the next split appeared, this time it moved right.

Next after a tunnel knitted with dry grass, there was a small round room of about 1 mel. There were one adult rat and three small rats by the wall eating what appeared to be grass seeds, and when they saw Tsukigake who came in running, an adult raised an alarming voice "kiki!!!", to which the guiding rat answered something calmly. Going near the small rats who were tracing a strange appearance with their eyes, lowering the head and entering a next passage.

Apparently, the wetland rats had a mesh of tunnels over this swamp. Without a guide, one would quickly get lost. As they run, plops echoed, so the bottom side of the floor seemed to be in contact with water. There must be a huge number of small islands scattered in wetlands connected with buoyant dead grass tunnels.

After the innumerable bifurcations, junctions and small rooms they ran through, he finally saw a point of light ahead. It seemed like a dead end, but the grass on the wall was sparse, and the setting sun was visible through that gaps.

The rat stopped at the end of the tunnel, protruded only a sharp nose into the gap in the grass, carefully sniffed the outside air and only then thrusted the head all the way out. When it was satisfied it got out through the grass.

After a bit of fighting with the grass Tsukigake also left the tunnel finding himself already at the southern part of the wetland area. The dry grassland spread ahead, and after it a wooden fence was seen that seemed to have been made by humans. Behind was the field that he saw from the carriage.

"Kyu-ru-ru, Ku-ru!!!"

*── Thank you, Rat. From here I can go alone.*

When Tsukigake said so, the brown rat tilted the neck to the right again:

"Kyu-ii?!"

*── When will give nuts?*

*── Do not have it now. But, I will have plenty of nuts soon, will come again. I promise.*

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>Decorative small toy [ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temari_(toy)).
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>So we had Iwanezumi previously, this is another species of Underworld rat. Naming is bit more complicated though. While “Nezumi” remains “rat”, and “nure” probably stays for wetland area it lives in, “miminaga” is the first part of the name they call Australian Bilbies (specifically, [dalgytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_bilby)). So, altogether that should be something like… “bilby-like swamp rat”?
