# Intro. A snow-white lily and a hawk that spread its wings.

Norlangarth Northern Empire’s coat of arms hanging on a jet-black wall was wrapped in a reddish flame.

A thick carpet covering the floor around the throne of Northern Centoria Imperial Castle was burnt here and there, and one could hear distant sword striking and cheerful voices echoing.

In about 20 Mel in front of Ronye and Tiese holding their swords, leaning on the back of gold and black leather throne which had soared surprisingly high, there was a single man sitting sedately. It seemed as if he was not worried at all about the way flames were spreading around the hall; his legs were joined together and his back was straight as a stick.

"...... I thought that it would be an Integrity Knight who stands before the ruler."

The man said while letting his fingertips to play with a sharp pointed gray beard.

"What’s that<!--(на русском: «Ё-моё», буквально)-->, just two girls who are neither knights nor guards...... are you students at the Sword Mastery Academy?"

There was no obligation to answer this arrogant question.

But Ronye dared to casually shake off pressure pushing her head down.

"── From Northern Centoria Sword Mastery Academy, junior trainee Ronye Arabel!"

Next Tiese also screamed with a ringing voice that mildly ached ears.

"Likewise, junior trainee Tiese Shtolienen!"

"Wow, it sounds like a green-behind-the ears who just held the real sword for the first time, but still thee overcome that useless doll."

The man glanced to the right.

There was a tall man lying sprawled out on the carpet wearing deep black metal armor with silver decorations. The inlay of the breastplate was the emblem of the Northern Centoria Empire Guards Corps. Although he was not dead, since he had to fight back Tiese’s and Ronye’s simultaneous continuous sword skill, he was not able to stand anymore.

The tall man who called himself the Emperor guarding Corps captain and Ronye with Tiese were engaged in a fierce fight for more than twenty minutes in this hall. If only one of them was fighting alone, she probably would not have won, and it would have been impossible for two of us to win either, if fought a traditional sword fight without using sacred arts. The fire burning in and around the hall was the consequence of Ronye’s fiery thermal element sacred art.

There was a strong enemy, but those who fought the captain were somewhat more impressive. 

Therefore, Ronye became strongly angry with dirty words of a man against his faithful servant who fought to defend him. 

Although she did not receive deep scratches, her arms that continued to parry captain's powerful sword strikes were dull and painful, there were countless cuts and puffing bruises. But forgetting the pain and fear for a moment, Ronye cried:

"This war is over! Now surrendered immediately and withdraw the edict to Konoe army!"

Tiese standing to the left also raised the voice.

"Integrity Knights and the Human World Defense Army will come soon! There is no escape!"

In truth, it is supposed to be Integrity Knight Dusolbert Synthesis Seven to lead the Northern Centoria strategy battle against nobility. Indeed, until the entrance to the corridor beside the throne, he was leading a unit to which Ronye and Tiese belonged.

But Dusolbert heard that the troops who were attacking the west gate of the castle were inferior, ordered Ronye and others "Go ahead!" and went to the rescue; meanwhile, members of the unit clashed with the Konoe army defending the corridor, so they also said "Go ahead!" and eventually only two of them had to rush into the throne hall.

It seemed that the course of events was rushing too fast but there was a reason for that.

This warfare later called the "Rebellion of Four Empires " began as the four emperors governing the four empires of the Human World, issued an imperial edict against the Human World Union Council just set up one month ago declaring that they are rebels who raided the Axiom Church and let their directly reporting Konoe army to invade Central Cathedral.

Knights and soldiers of the Konoe Army were not absolute enemies like Red Knights who have attacked in the time of a Foreign World War, but people living in the same Centoria city. Therefore, their sacrifice must be kept to a minimum ── that was the intention of Kirito, the appointed Prime Swordsman of Human World Union Council.

If all Integrity Knights and clerics stayed inside the Central Cathedral and devoted themselves to defense and let the Human World Defense Army stationed in the center of Centoria to attack from behind, it would have been possible to annihilate the Konoe army completely.

However, Kirito did not take that strategy, almost all Integrity Knights left the Cathedral, joined the Defense Army and were ordered to enter the Imperial Castles of the four empires. In order to conclude this battle with minimal causalities, there was no choice but to capture the four emperors and withdraw the edict. Therefore, members of their unit entrusted a big role of breaking into the throne hall into Ronye and Tiese, as they themselves became a decoy and attracted the large number of troops of the Konoe army.

Today Kirito and Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna left continuing to defend the Cathedral with a small number of subordinate knights, guards and clerics. Even for the most powerful swordsmen in Human World, it was not an easy task to hold the East, West, North and South gates where the four Konoe armies rushed.

_Discard the decree as soon as possible and put an end to the battle of Northern Centoria._

Although the words of two people were filled with a determination, the cold and noble face of the man on the throne — the Norlangarth Empire Emperor Krueger Norlangarth VI — did not express any tremor.

"....... A daughter of a lower-class nobleman, whose name I haven’t even herd before, turns her sword against the ruler of hers. Even taking this one thing, isn’t is obvious that the Union Conference and those loose rebels are destroying the order and well-being of our Human World?"

Having said that with placid face, the emperor lifted the crystal bowl from a small round table placed beside the throne containing deep purple liquid and brought it to his mouth.

The wine to be drank by the emperor was grown in the richest land blessed with the grace of Solus and Terraria and located in the emperor’s own territory or the territory of nobility; they say that the price of one bottle is above the monthly wage of lower classes — Ronye once heard from her father. If all the vineyards are turned into wheat fields, the demand of wheat consumed in the whole city of Northern Centoria would be satisfied.

_The reign forgiving such a luxury can not be tolerated._

"What did you, old man, do for the Human World!?"

Ronye shouted, pointing the tip of the sword to the emperor’s face.

"In the recent Foreign World War, Human World...... only warriors of regular citizens and lower-class aristocrats fought to protect people living here!"

"Oh yeah! All the great aristocrats shut themselves down in castles within their dominions and could only sit there frightened!"

Tiese who shouted it, pointed the index finger of the left hand to the emperor, but not the sword. Though, it was still an act subjected to disciplinary punishment by aristocratic jurisdiction. For the first time here, there was a slight but unpleasant wrinkle above the emperor’s nose.

"...... Oh really?"

Turning the wine in the glass, the emperor said:

"The duty of lower nobility and senior guards is to defend the surplus by betting the lives. And more than servants, this must guide the empire’s populace. Yes, so far only the territory of the Northern Empire was where my hand reached, but as long as the Highest Priest honored an everlasting sleep, the Axiom Church was broken down by those who makes no reasoning, and this is a mistake that I must also correct. The Human World unity...... instead of that rootless whiffed known only by a mere swordsmanship, it is me, Krueger Norlangarth who will accomplish it!"

Having declared this pretentious speech aloud, the emperor drank what remained of the wine and threw the glass onto the floor.

While expensive crystal bowl was shattered and scattered around, the ruler stood up slowly from the throne and picked up the long sword that was standing on the side.

A blade shining like a mirror emerged from the deep-red sheath decorated magnificently to such extent that Ronye had never seen before.

A thing reminiscent of a cold wind blew from the throne located on a triple podium, and Ronye pulled her right leg a little bit away. But she stayed on the spot for a while and finally got the body moving forward.

Despite they did not come to war, it is not that the royalty and great aristocrats cannot use the sword.

Of course, senior aristocrats who rigorously exercise hard training every day, like the elite swordsman­in­training Wolo Levantain they met last year, are rare. However, according to Kirito's explanation, senior aristocracy routinely conducts hunting in the suburbs, which is a privilege granted only to them, to raise the level of control authority. Also, because nobility children enroll into Sword Mastery Academy almost without exceptions, there are opportunities to acquire minimum sword skills.

So, if one was to became an emperor, it was supposed that from an early age an exclusive teacher would help to develop their sword skills, and numerous opportunities to hunt a large beast would arise. The sword that the emperor was holding clearly radiated with the priority higher than the Human Army personnel sword Ronye possessed.

From the corridor behind, the sound of a squad clashing with Konoe army echoed without interruption.

Several coat-of-arms hanging down on the left and right walls were burning out one after another.

The emperor's long sword reflected the color of the flame, shining dazzling red.

Although she came from a lower class, Ronye was also belonging to nobility. Awe and faithfulness to the empire and the Emperor imprinted in her heart since childhood were not going to disappear even after turning the sword against them. But that time Ronye knew something more important than blind obedience.

When Kirito and Yujio were students of the same Sword Mastery Academy as these two, they fought with not less than the semi-god of the Human World, the highest priest Administrator.

_For Kirito who is trying hard to keep the Central Cathedral — and for the new era to be welcomed by the Human World, I cannot retreat._

"If you say that you don’t withdraw the edict... I will slash you right here!"

Ronye cried so and moved the standard sword over her right shoulder.

Tiese standing next to her also transitioned from the basic middle stand to Incrad style sword skill stance.

Emperor Krueger who lost the smile raised the sword up as if to hit the sky and took a stance of High Norkia style.

At that moment, when the flame reached the enormous tapestry hanging behind the throne, Ronye unexpectedly kicked off the floor.

Suddenly the floor lost its hardness and a dark big hole opened its mouth instead.

Without being able to scream, Ronye felt in the hole, and ──
