# Part 1

"Unforgi…!"

Such word jumped out of her throat the moment her back felt the shock.

She pulled away a cloth clinging to her face and after some struggling in the darkness she noticed that this was her bedroom. Apparently, she had just fallen from the bed.

It was still dark outside the window. She faintly grabbed the blanket and climbed back onto the bed.

It was late February, and every day it felt that it’s getting warmer, but it was still cool before dawn. _I wish Central Cathedral would have a hot water heating device like Obsidia in the Dark Territory_, she thought...... then firmly wrapped the blanket around and let out a brief breath.

Ronye did not normally have problems with sleep — it was probably because she had been dreaming of that day that she moved so hard that she has fell to the floor. She used to forget the content as soon as she woke up, but that night's dream still remained in her head.

After the end of a Foreign World War, they returned to the central capital in mid-November 380th of the Human World calendar. In December the Human World Union Council was launched and it was only a February of 381th when the Rebellion of Four Empires broke out so it was just a year ago when Ronye and Tiese had crossed swords with the Northern Empire’s, Krueger Norlangarth.

_Maybe it is because of that dream, and why do people need to have dreams in the first place……_ but even though she was waiting for sleeping fairies to come again, her eyelids did not get heavy. She laid still for about three minutes, then the bells outside of the window delivered a subdued 5 AM tone, so she gave up and set on the bed.

She got feet down to the floor, threw over a thick woolen shawl and reached for the table lamp. Turning a large screw in the middle of the barrel, she let water filling the glass-made burner to flow down to the lower container, and the egg-sized piece of ore contained in the burner ignited by itself and release the soft yellow light.

Before they returned home from Dark Territory two days ago, Kirito had packed ten more ore lamps, exclusive Obsidia produce, into the luggage compartment of the dragon, to give them as a souvenir to everyone. Ronye and Tiese also got one each, and got used to them immediately, since to ignite it was enough just to drop the water level, and extinguishing was also very easy —just to turn the lamp upside down to return water to the burner; besides, it was much cheaper compared to conventional oil lamps, and even to light element lamps used in Cathedral, as it was unnecessary to generate an element.

Of course, ore — it seems locals called the stone Luminolite — would not continue to burn indefinitely, if one keeps the fire constantly on, it burns out in about four days. In other words, although Ronye and others could use this lamp at will, one would think it will become a waste if in one-month time, but Kirito seemed to want to import large quantities of luminous stone from the Dark Territory.

Since it begins to burn without permission unless it is submerged in a certain amount of water, a certain skill is necessary to carry it a long distance, so if this becomes stable, the night of Centoria will become even brighter, likewise Obsidia's situation with continued refugees' influx and work being hard to find is also somewhat aided.

Nonetheless, the situation in the Dark Territory could not be improved with just ore. Although Kirito was trying to solve the fundamental problem that the fertility and sunlight amount is insufficient to harvest agricultural crops enough for it’s population, it seems that he has not yet reached any result.

Under such circumstances, Kirito is committing the greatest hope to the other side of the "end wall of the world" that surrounds all Underworld, but there are many problems here as well. _Will a machine dragon be able to really exceed an infinite cliff that could never be overcame by a living thing.... and even if it does, I there a new ground spreading beyond that wall, or only pure "emptiness" lays beyond?_

"............ Still......."

After thinking this way for a moment, Ronye shut this burden in her heart and moved again.

She lifted a long sword, placed in a sheath of black leather from the stand beside the chest of drawers. Then she took out a small wooden box from a drawer and returned to the table.

This sword, having silvery shining guard reminiscent of the crescent moon and the handle wrapped with the same black leather as the sheath, was given to her five days ago by the Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna. It had Priority 39, which is too much for knight trainee, even though it does not qualify to the Divine Object class.

The blade she gently pulled out of the sheath gleamed faintly in the light of the ore lamp, but there was a small scratch on a part of it. It was when she slashed the left arm of a black robe man who kidnapped Lisetta, daughter of general commander Isukan and ambassador Scheta, at the top floor of Obsidia castle.

The sword's life itself was already recovered because it was contained in the sheath for two days, but dirt and scratches would not disappear without care.

She put the sword on the table and opened the wooden box. First, she removed the dirt by wiping the blades, guard and handle with white cotton cloth. Then poured some polishing oil on the leather of the Silver-Fur Deer of Southern Empire and polished the blade carefully.

Kirito and Yujio during the time of Sword Mastery Academy frequently talked about taking care of swords while handling the Sword of the Night Sky and the Sword of the Blue Rose. Ronye was fond of watching them closely at that times. She still felt that one and a half months Tiese and herself were doing a valet duty was the most enjoyable and most brilliant days of her 17 years life.

_As the Foreign World War and the Rebellion of the Four Empires concluded, and peace has returned to life in Cathedral, I certainly find it enjoyable. Although sword skill, sacred art and incarnation trainings are difficult, I sincerely wish these days to last forever. But every time I realize that Tiese's face or Kirito's profile may eventually fade away, Yujio will not be able to return anymore... and I am conscious of how important his existence was.  
Kirito and Yujio, Ronye and Tiese. How precious was the time spent by four of us, can it be compared to anything at all? But it is lost forever, never to return.  
............ No.  
Perhaps, it is not only because of Yujio that I feel this way._

It could be due to unlike Tiese's love, Ronye’s own feelings will never be rewarded anymore, and everything around kept reminding her of this.......

"Ah……"

She accidentally slid her hand and the blade brushed the belly of her thumb. When she put the sword away and looked at her fingertips, there was little pain, but a blood bead emerged from the shallow cut.

Ronye lowered her left hand which lifted reflexively to produce a light element. She put the thumb against her lips and traced the cut with the tongue. Blood ceased immediately, but it will take some time for the wound to disappear. _But this shall be an admonition to myself who thought too much while handling the sword._

She ended wiping the blade with oily leather, finished with a soft cloth to remove any tarnish and returned the sword to the sheath.

From now on she must little by little deepen the binding with her new love sword she just has named the "Sword of the Moonlight". By the time she will be able to fully use this sword she surely had to organize the feelings she had.

She got up and returned the sword and care equipment to the chest of drawers, shawl was thrown to the bed and the night dress swiftly followed. That moment she suddenly shivered and let out one small sneeze.

_Why do people sneeze? Let's ask Kirito along with reasons for dreaming next time..._ Ronye hurried to the cupboard where the knight clothes were hung out.
