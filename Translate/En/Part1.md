# Part 1

"Unforgi…!"

Such word jumped out of her throat the moment her back felt the shock.

She pulled away a cloth clinging to her face and after some struggling in the darkness she noticed that this was her bedroom. Apparently, she had just fallen from the bed.

It was still dark outside the window. She faintly grabbed the blanket and climbed back onto the bed.

It was late February, and every day it felt that it’s getting warmer, but it was still cool before dawn. _I wish Central Cathedral would have a hot water heating device like Obsidia in the Dark Territory_, she thought...... then firmly wrapped the blanket around and let out a brief breath.

Ronye did not normally have problems with sleep — it was probably because she had been dreaming of that day that she moved so hard that she has fell to the floor. She used to forget the content as soon as she woke up, but that night's dream still remained in her head.

After the end of a Foreign World War, they returned to the central capital in mid-November 380th of the Human World calendar. In December the Human World Union Council was launched and it was only a February of 381th when the Rebellion of Four Empires broke out so it was just a year ago when Ronye and Tiese had crossed swords with the Northern Empire’s, Krueger Norlangarth.

_Maybe it is because of that dream, and why do people need to have dreams in the first place……_ but even though she was waiting for sleeping fairies to come again, her eyelids did not get heavy. She lay still for about three minutes, then the bells outside of the window delivered a subdued 5 AM tone, so she gave up and set on the bed.

She got feet down to the floor, threw over a thick woolen shawl and reached for the table lamp. Turning a large screw in the middle of the barrel, she let water filling the glass-made burner to flow down to the lower container, and the egg-sized piece of ore contained in the burner ignited by itself and release the soft yellow light.

Before they returned home from Dark Territory two days ago, Kirito had packed ten more ore lamps, exclusive Obsidia produce, into the luggage compartment of the dragon, to give them as a souvenir to everyone. Ronye and Tiese also got one each, and they got used to them immediately, since to ignite it was enough just to drop the water level, and extinguishing was also very easy —just to turn the lamp upside down to return water to the burner; besides, it was much cheaper compared to conventional oil lamps, and even to light element lamps used in Cathedral, as it was unnecessary to generate an element.

Of course, ore — it seems locals called the stone Luminolite — would not continue to burn indefinitely, if one keeps the fire constantly on, it burns out in about four days. In other words, although Ronye and others could use this lamp at will, one would think it will become a waste if in one-month time, but Kirito seemed to want to import large quantities of luminous stone from the Dark Territory.

Since it begins to burn without permission unless it is submerged in a certain amount of water, a certain skill is necessary to carry it a long distance, but if this becomes stable, the night of Centoria will become even brighter, likewise Obsidia's situation with continued refugees' influx and work being hard to find is also somewhat aided.

Nonetheless, the situation in the Dark Territory could not be improved with just ore. Although Kirito was trying to solve the fundamental problem that the fertility and sunlight amount is insufficient to harvest agricultural crops enough for it’s population, it seems that he has not yet reached any result.

Under such circumstances, Kirito is committing the greatest hope to the other side of the "end wall of the world" that surrounds all Underworld, but there are many problems here as well. _Will a machine dragon be able to really exceed an infinite cliff that could never be overcame by a living thing.... and even if it does, is there a new ground spreading beyond that wall, or only pure "emptiness" lies beyond?_

"............ Still......."

After thinking this way for a moment, Ronye shut this burden in her heart and moved again.

She took the long sword out of black leather sheath placed at the stand beside the chest of drawers. Then she took out a small wooden box from a drawer and returned to the table.

This sword, having silvery shining guard reminiscent of the crescent moon and the handle wrapped with the same black leather as the sheath, was given to her five days ago by the Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna. It had Priority 39, which is too much for knight trainee, even though it does not qualify to the Divine Object class.

The blade she gently pulled out of the sheath gleamed faintly in the light of the ore lamp, but there was a small scratch on a part of it. It was when she slashed the left arm of a black robe man who kidnapped Lisetta, daughter of general commander Isukan and ambassador Scheta, at the top floor of Obsidia castle.

The sword's life itself was already recovered because it was contained in the sheath for two days, but dirt and scratches would not disappear without care.

She put the sword on the table and opened the wooden box. First, she removed the dirt by wiping the blade, guard and handle with white cotton cloth. Then poured some polishing oil on the leather of the Silver-Fur Deer of Southern Empire and began to polish the blade carefully.

Kirito and Yujio during the time of Sword Mastery Academy frequently talked about taking care of swords while handling the Sword of the Night Sky and the Sword of the Blue Rose. Ronye was fond of watching them closely at that times. She still felt that one and a half months Tiese and herself were doing a valet duty was the most enjoyable and most brilliant days of her 17 years life.

_As the Foreign World War and the Rebellion of the Four Empires concluded, and peace has returned to life in Cathedral, I certainly find it enjoyable. Although sword skill, sacred art and incarnation trainings are difficult, I sincerely wish these days to last forever. But every time I realize that Tiese's face or Kirito's profile may eventually fade away, Yujio will not be able to return anymore... and I am conscious of how important his existence was.  
Kirito and Yujio, Ronye and Tiese. How precious was the time spent by four of us, can it be compared to anything at all? But it is lost forever, never to return.  
............ No.  
Perhaps, it is not only because of Yujio that I feel this way._

It could be due to unlike Tiese's love, Ronye’s own feelings will never be rewarded anymore, and everything around kept reminding her of this.......

"Ah……"

She accidentally slid her hand and the blade brushed the belly of her thumb. When she put the sword away and looked at her fingertips, there was little pain, but a blood bead emerged from the shallow cut.

Ronye lowered her left hand which lifted reflexively to produce a light element. She put the thumb against her lips and traced the cut with the tongue. _Blood ceased already, but it will take some time for the wound to disappear. But this shall be an admonition to myself who thought too much while handling the sword._

She ended wiping the blade with oily leather, finished with a soft cloth to remove any tarnish and returned the sword to the sheath.

From now on she must little by little deepen the binding with her new love sword she just has named the "Sword of the Moonlight". By the time she will be able to fully use this sword she surely had to organize the feelings she had.

She got up and returned the sword and care equipment to the chest of drawers, shawl was thrown to the bed and the night dress swiftly followed. That moment she suddenly shivered and let out one small sneeze.

_Why do people sneeze? Let's ask Kirito along with reasons for dreaming next time..._ Ronye hurried to the cupboard where the knight clothes were hung out.

***

23<sup>rd</sup> February, 380 by Human World calendar.

The cold rain that began before dawn was pouring over large glass windows of the Cathedral’s fiftieth floor called the "Great Corridor of Spiritual Light".

In this hall, which was named the large corridor, there was a handrailed gallery around the high wall. Ronye and Tiese went up there and watched the state of the conference proceeding before their eyes.

Why in the gallery, not by the round table, — it was because Berchie whom Fanatio entrusted to them was in a relatively high spirit if he was taken to some high location. Certainly, the fiftieth floor itself was more than two hundred mels away from the ground, but it was separated by thick walls and solid glass, so it seemed that a one year old child could not feel the height.

"Hey Ronye, you saw Scheta-san's baby at Obsidia, right?"

Tiese whispered while slowly rocking sleeping Berchie.

"Yeah, I also gave her **milk**."

"Wish I was there. She should be about three months old, I guess, is she cute?"

"Much more than that. She already had hair and it was quite curly, her eyes were bright are on top of that..."

Hearing words of Ronye, Tiese got entranced and gazed straight without focusing on anything.

"This… Berchie-boy is also cute when sleeping, but boys and girls are different, are they not? I wonder if Scheta-san brings her next time she comes home..."

_Probably_, — Ronye was ready to answer but swallowed the word.

Ronye had not told her best friend yet that Lisetta, the daughter of Scheta and Isukan, was kidnapped for about half a day. It was so because Kirito reminded her not to tell anyone until reporting at today's meeting, but the feeling of discomfort associated with that secret between two of them only increased rather than dissolving even after several days.

_I can understand why kidnappers targeted Lisetta. If one aims to intimidate Kirito, there will not be any hostage more effective than Lisa. A Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna, perhaps, but I do not believe there’s a villain capable of kidnapping her exists at present in Underworld._

On the other hand, the method was quite mysterious.

They invaded near the top floor of the Obsidia Castle, which is severely guarded and is located at a height of as much as five hundred mels, although it does not exceed the Cathedral; moreover, after kidnapping Lisetta, it was the fiftieth floor that could not be unlocked — where they opened a window by the throne and hid in there. After being uncovered by Kirito's actions, even after Ronye slashed his left arm off and he had to jump out of the window, a corpse could not be found.

Ronye certainly saw the gem hanging on the kidnapper's chest glowing red when the window on the fiftieth floor opened. The general commander Isukan who heard it said that a similar stone had been fitted to the crown of Dark Territory Emperor Vector who died in the Foreign World War.

Isukan also speculated that the kidnapper belonged to assassin guild, but the guild seemed to have already been dismissed. Moreover, the artificial organism "minion" which the kidnapper used to confuse the guards of the castle is said to be produced only by the Dark Arts guild which is also remarkably weakened.

_What is going on in Dark Territory... and in Human World?  
Who are they and what are they trying to achieve...?_

"── all in all, that’s an outline of what happened at Obsidia Castle."

Suddenly, Kirito's voice echoing in the conference hall reached Ronye and brought her back from her thoughts.

Next to her, Tiese let our surprised voice:

"Eh...... you, were you involved in such a thing over there?"

Apparently, it seemed that Kirito had explained the same thing Ronye was tracing in her mind. She furtively glanced at the face of her best friend and nodded, shrugging:

"Well, yeah ... but, but it wasn’t especially dangerous there."

"It's quite dangerous, I guess, as you had to attack a guy who would kidnap a baby with the sword! That sounds as dangerous... it's almost as dangerous as to make an instructor angry..."

"Should you had said such a thing back then at Academy, that would......"

As Ronye shook her head, the meeting in the hall went ahead.

"I do not want to complain about what happened, but Prime Swordsman-dono, I remember saying the same the other day! Every job has someone who makes a call!"

The owner of the thick voice reminiscent of a steel bow sound was Integrity Knight Dusolbert Synthesis Seven. Although, due to early morning time, instead of the usual red copper armor he wore Kimono of the eastern style, the severity of reprimand did not change.

"Obsidia Castle also has a number of guards, leave the gamble to them! Prime Swordsman now is the key to not just the Human World, yet all Underworld, if there is something happening to you, how much confusion will occur in both worlds should be understood!"

When Dusolbert closes his mouth, Fanatio Synthesis Two, the second generation knight leader who used to play the role of the one limiting him, said in a serious voice:

"I also agree with Dusolbert this time. Boy, I want you to understand that the era when the Prime took the sword himself and fought the enemy himself, is now over."

To these words, Renri Synthesis Twenty-Seven, who was also present, and all the heads of Cathedral departments, all nodded together.

Wearing black clothes Prime swordsman, who became a main point of the discussion instead of the meeting agenda, made a delicate face and attempted a counterattack from the northern side of the large circular table, with a tone that lacked profoundness.

"Well, I understand what everyone wants to say... but, you see, the previous knights leader Bercouli was flying voluntarily to the Mountain Range at the Edge and fighting dark knights, did he not? Even if I am given a managerial position of a Prime, I guess that one cannot earn trust only by sitting in a safe place after all..."

_── What he is saying is fine, but it sounds like a child's excuse when I hear something like this from Kirito-senpai._

Thought Ronye standing on the gallery ──

"The position of His Excellence Bercouli and your position of Prime Swordsman differ!"

A voice akin to the sharpened blade hit the hall, filling it entirely.

The speaker was a slender knight who did not participate in the meeting the other day.

His armor of an elegant design was pale green. Unusual dark green hair was long enough to touch the floor and hung on a chair, but that was a man. A long spear with the head covered with a pointed leather shell stood behind his back on the floor without any support.

A long-haired knight continued to shout looking at Kirito.

"His Excellency Bercouli continued his long fighting to protect Human World and Axiom Church by the order of her Holiness Highest Priest Administrator! But no one is granted the right to give orders to Prime Swordsman-dono...... hence I conclude that a duty for him is strictly to govern!"

Kirito attempted to refute lingering a little due to his language.

"Bu…but, if that's the reason, then I can command myself......"

The same moment the knight cracking his armor half-raised above the table.

But before even heavier scolding sounded, the current knight leader Fanatio suddenly interrupted.

"Please calm down a bit, Negi-boy."

"I am not green onion<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, it is Nergius!"

Although he had retorted indignantly, the knight named Nergius Synthesis Sixteen sat down suddenly calmed down. It was senior Integrity Knight who continued to protect the Axiom Church for over a hundred years.

According to the Human World naming principles, the name of Nergius was to welcome intelligence, resoluteness and virtuousness. However, hearing the owner of the Divine Object "Storm Sprout Spear", Ronye inclined to a more straightforward meaning of the name.

In a certain remote rural area of the Wesdarath West Empire, vegetables called Riko onions are said to be special products since long ago. Double as long as ordinary, with onions of triple thickness, and four times more sweet and delicious ─ at least this way they are advertised, but anyhow, once upon a time one farmer noticed that there are exceptionally tall Riko green onion growing in a corner of the field.

The delighted farmer carefully looked after it every day, to raise it even higher. The green onion grew steadily and quickly exceeded the length of 1 mel, reaching 2 mel.

Eventually rumors of haunted onion spread and many visitors gathered from nearby villages and towns. The farmer grew greedy, ceased harvesting the vegetable, but instead he understood that there was a way to get benefit and began to take coins from the onlookers wandering about the onion. Meanwhile the green onion grew to 3 mel, then to 4 mel and it’s thickness reached 50 cen. Originally supposed to be white, it got a silver metallic luster, and the green color of its leaves also increased vividness daily.

A few months passed, and the farmer noticed an abnormality in his own field. The young buds of newly seeded Rico onion did not grow up. Growth inferiority also affected the field of other people next door, eventually farmers in the village began to rumor that the cause of the anomaly is the haunted onion of which the farmer took care.

At last the gathering of the villagers ruled that the farmer had to dispose of onion. At that time, the farmer tried to pull out the onion which had reached seven mel in height. First, he tried to pull it out with a cow, but the onion did not bow at all, then he tried to cut it down with an ax, but the blade did not pass through. At the time he tried himself to dig out the root, the sky suddenly became cloudy and the fierce storm hit the village.

The wind and rain raged for quite a while, and when they finally fell, the farmer’s Riko onion field turned into a vast pool of mud, with the haunted onion growing lively in the middle ─

Nergius' Storm Sprout Spear is said to be converted by Highest Priest Administrator from haunted onion. Priority lay in the area of sacred treasures, but on top of that it had quite unusual special effect: it could stand untouched on the floor and the ground even if there was no support and it seemed that it never fell even if it was tilted.

It’s owner is similarly simple and single-minded person; it is without any doubt a noble knight who has been doing years of service for the Axiom Church, but Ronye did not have a very good impression of him. Because when the highest priest Administrator was defeated it was Nergius who insisted the most that Kirito must be executed as a rebel.

Although the immediate execution was avoided because the previous knight leader Bercouli persuaded the hardliners, they said that the knight Alice had to leave Centoria with Kirito. Moreover, the faction led by Nergius did not participate in a Foreign World War and remained in the defense of Cathedral and of the Mountain Range at the Edge, so even in that sense mental barrier between them was not thinner.

To calm himself, Nergius lifted a cup of tea provided to the round table and drank it with a breath. A new ─ but rather relaxed — voice flowed this time to a slightly relaxed atmosphere.

"Well, come to think of it, if Kirito-sensei does everything by himself, I feel a kind of loneliness as if I am not being trusted. Same here, Negio?"

Nergius who heard it stared at the right beside himself while holding an empty cup.

"I did not say anything about feeling lonely!"

Although he snapped back, there was no complain about the strange nickname of "Negio". It seemed though that he gave up, rather than accepted it.

The one who said that was a young knight of same age as Nergius — of course, judging by appearance. He was slightly taller than Nergius, and somewhat sturdier. His hair was cut short to two or three cen, color of his armor was purplish blue. He owned a classic long sword as a weapon and, of course, it was not standing on the floor by itself, but rather hung on the left hip.

His name was Entokia Synthesis Eighteen. He was also a senior knight, and he also has not participated in a Foreign World War. Like Nergius’, his face hasn’t been seen around for several months because they were in an expedition to the South Empire. It seemed to be about investigating whether one can pass the last tunnel that penetrates the mountain range that was buried long ago.

In response to Entokia's remark, Kirito, who seemed to be the second youngest in the hall after Renri, replied while stirring his black hair.

"Hmm...... I also understand what Nergius-san and Entokia-san say, but after all it is not my nature to command from within the tower. Besides, I am not doing everything alone, in fact the two of you actually did the hard work in the Southern Empire......."

"Oh, there!”

It was Entokia who suddenly shouted in a loud voice, and Kirito reflexively winced.

"What there?"

"When you refer to myself and him, you can leave that ‘-san’ aside. If you call me ‘Enki’ and call Negio ‘Negio’, then together it will be......."

"Enough! Thou can nominate yourself at will, but don’t involve me into this!"

Nergius shouted as if seriously irritated, and Tiese quietly laughed next to Ronye. If seen, she wouldn’t be looking good, but the aforementioned Integrity Knight and others did not hear whispering voices from the far gallery.

"...... He’s not so bad, this one…maybe? "

Ronye also nodded a little to Tiese's murmuring.

"Fanatio-sama was mentioning before. _We all trust Kirito so much because we fought hard together once._ Perhaps, Dusolbert-sama... and I think that it was the same with Alice-sama. As for Nergius-sama and Entokia-sama, when Kirito-senpai and Yujio-senpai broke into the Cathedral, they would have been in the security guard mission at the Mountain Range at the Edge..."

"I see……. Anyway, why Entokia-san called senpai ‘Kirito-sensei’?"

"Who knows……"

Dusolbert who was sitting with his head down for some time, vigorously slapped his hands on the table and put the story back to the main topic.

"Please deepen the friendship between you and the Prime Swordsman-dono as much as you like after the meeting and now I want you to talk about urgent matters."

Nergius who heard it, straightened his posture and nodded, and Entokia lifted both hands showing consent.

"Well...... from listening to the story of the Prime Swordsman-dono, it seems like there is a power that is trying to clash the Human World and the Dark Territory again. If the plan of the man in the black robe succeeded and the Prime Swordsman-dono was to be executed in public at Obsidia, the exchange project would surely stop, and our worlds would have parted ways...... I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended up in the state of war."

It was the youngest knight, Renri Synthesis Twenty-Seven who followed the words of Dusolbert.

"Especially since Kirito-san's popularity in the central capital has been so high since we reformed the aristocratic system and released all the territory.... Even if he’s just a hero who has defeated the Emperor Vector it would be enough, so it is natural after he also showed his skill at the state management."

Kirito who was listening to it shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably as was expected by Ronye.

"No, it was the heads of departments of the Axiom Church who supported the practice of administrative reform, and there are also people like Solteri... general Selrut and instructor Levantain and other senior aristocrats who cooperated. Even if I did not order, they freed their territory. ……In addition,……"

Kirito remained silent for some time and then continued in a quiet voice.

"......People of the central capital, of the Human World, they do not know that it is me who killed the Highest Priest and the former Chief Elder. In the end, the support for the Human World Union Council is the same as the worship of the Axiom Church....... Citizens still believe that the Highest Priest is on the top floor of the Cathedral for in a period of sleep. If it happens that it becomes publicly known that I killed her, my popularity will be erased in a blink of an eye."

With these Kirito’s words, Nergius' facial expression became grim again.

Of course, as it was mentioned above, as soon as the Highest Priest Administrator passed away, the knight chief Bercouli gathered all the Integrity Knights that were in the Central Cathedral in this Great Corridor of Spiritual Light, and the knight Alice revealed the majority of the secrets of the Axiom Church.

The highest priest was trying to make huge monsters combining countless swords like a skeleton in preparation for the upcoming war with Dark Territory. And for material, she planned to turn bodies of half of the people living in Human World into those swords.

Furthermore, the Elders Council, the highest-ranking organization giving orders to Integrity Knights was essentially a fiction consisting of the former Chief Elder Chudelkin alone. Knights who suddenly disappeared without any reason turned out to be put into a long sleep by the sacred art "Deep Freeze" which Chudelkin cast.

It seems that the hardliners led by Nergius agreed to refrain from executing Kirito because they saw seven Integrity Knights frozen in the chamber of Elders Council. Even now the analysis of the Deep Freeze technique has not been completed and they remain asleep at the top of the Cathedral.

And one more thing. The last Integrity Knight, Eldrie Synthesis Thirty-One who similarly considered Kirito a rebel, participated in the Foreign World War until losing his life in the defense of Great Eastern Gate, which might have influenced the attitude of stubborn Nergius who were...... given that Dusolbert was telling this during the course of the study.

Ronye and Tiese hadn’t really had a chance to exchange words with knight Eldrie as they had sometimes passed by each other at the Great Eastern Gate. However, the image of knight’s somewhat sad expression and light-purple curly hair fluttering jauntily as he walked along was strong in their memory.

The knight chief Bercouli revealed the majority of the Highest Priest's secrets to the knights, but one thing he never said — or he could not say it. Particularly, the largest secret of Integrity Knights’, "Synthesis Ritual".

Integrity Knight with tremendous power is summoned to the Human World from the gods’ world by the prayer of the Highest Priest, and should he die at the mission and lose his life then he returns to the gods’ world again... or that’s the way it was supposed to be. However, only Integrity Knights themselves believed in it.

In fact, they brought to the Cathedral those who showed sword power enough to win the Four Empires Unified Martial Arts Contest or possessed a spiritual power enough to conflict with a Taboo Index, sealed their memories, and synthesized into an Integrity Knight called from the gods’ world by giving false memories.

Such a dangerous fiction worked well for hundreds of years, basically, because Integrity Knights did not communicate with the public. Only when punishing those who broke the law had they a chance to exchange a word with people. And that happened only once in decades.

So, the family of Integrity Knight believed that their son or daughter got the highest honor in the Human World, while the tragedy of the knight himself robbed off the memories of their family at all was repeated over and over again.

However, the situation was gradually changing. Since the Foreign World War and the Rebellion of Four Empires, some knights were approached by soldiers of the Human World Defense Army, and as soon as they got chance to talk about the past, the origin of the knight would become a topic. _The time will have to reveal to the all knights that not so long ago, Integrity Knights were originally human beings and the gods’ world does not exist..._ that was what Kirito declared once with a difficult face.

_That's right — Kirito carries too many challenges at present.  
If I were not an apprentice, but a regular knight with the right to sit by the round table, even then I wouldn’t selfishly call out that my opponent is hundred years old synthesized knight..._ while thinking so, Ronye kept listening to the meeting room.

It seemed that Fanatio and Dusolbert could not react soon to Kirito’s dangerous remark about him killing the Highest Priest. It was the knight Nergius who first broke the silence with heavy, but unexpectedly calm voice.

"...I do not intend to return to the discussion of Prime Swordsman-dono's past here, and I believe that if it is possible to build a permanent peace with Dark Territory, that is the best way to go."

Entokia also followed the remarks of his partner.

"There is no objection there. In the first place, even if you look in the Taboo Index, it doesn’t prohibit to fight the Highest Priest-sama... because it is not written there."

As he said those words, the two oldest knights sighed in amazement.

_There may not be such a clause indeed, but it is clearly written that in the first place, chapter 1, article 1, paragraph 1 of the Taboo Index, no one should rebel against the Axiom Church. Breaking out from a Cathedral dungeon and defeating a number of Integrity Knights, and finally fighting the former Chief Elder and the Highest Priests is obviously a rebellion against the church..._ thought Ronye. Even though she has become a knight trainee and was released from the Taboo Index and obligation to comply with the Imperial Fundamental Law, she still could not think that she could do the same thing herself.

On the other hand, Kirito and Yujio at that time were cooperating with another Highest Priest, Cardinal, who was once the same as the Highest Priest Administrator. Cardinal healed Fanatio who was seriously injured in the fight against Kirito, and they say she had lost her life in the fight against the Administrator.

Then, it also develops into a problem of legal interpretation of what the "Axiom Church" described in the Taboo Index specifically stands for....... In the past, when doubts appeared in the text of the Taboo Index, it would have been better to ask the Highest Priest or the Chief Elder, but the two of them did not exist anymore. And Integrity Knights were not given the right to make their own interpretation of Taboo Index.

In other words, as Kirito himself mentioned, the title of Human World Union Council Prime Swordsman, even in Human World — and within the Axiom Church, has never gained the meaningful weight.

"── Investigation on black robe man we’ll only have to leave to Scheta and Commander Isukan."

While combining the fingers of both hands on the table, Fanatio said.

"It is impossible for us to get that person, whether they are from the Dark Territory’s Assassin Guild of from the Dark Arts Masters’ Guild. By no other means there is a way than to send a spy to Obsidia, I suppose."

"I think that it is better to quit it, I am afraid they can be caught by the enemy and used against us. If you send someone......."

It looked like all the people who arrived at the round table were to say “I would go myself”, exchanging looks and nodding at the same time.

"...Well, OK, let's quit, yeah. So — what, waiting for a report from Dark Territory on the case of Yazen-san's murder? Which means ── we cannot release the mountain goblin Oroi kept in the Cathedral for now..."

As Kirito said this with a thoughtful face, Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna sitting next to him began talking. Perhaps it was because she saw him being patiently trying not to tell the hardest thing to Nergius.

"I am doing my best to provide maximum hospitality to Oroi, and I have taken him to sightseeing of Cathedral every day, so he’s not complaining about the limited freedom state at the moment. But, he’s a little bit **homesick**... that would be... um......"

She glimpsed to Kirito, but he seemed not to be coming up with the proper Human World translation of the sacred word that Asuna has said.

"…well, how would you call a situation where you are feeling nostalgic and missing your family and friends?"

Knights and the heads of departments asked by Asuna, began turning heads to each other all together.

"Um...... I can understand that feeling, but we do not have families and our home is this Cathedral... when it comes to expressing in a word..."

Ronye and Tiese exchanged looks while listening to the groaning voice of Dusolbert. Although they didn’t take long journeys, sometimes suddenly they felt such a feeling in the dormitory of Sword Mastery Academy so they also knew how to call it. Tiese poked her, so she reluctantly leaned out from the gallery and screamed.

"Well, I think it is a "hometown missing illness"!

Everyone in the conference hall looked up at Ronye and began nodding. When she hurriedly retracted her face, little Berchie surprised by Ronye's loud voice began moving in Tiese's arms. However, when Tiese shook him a little, started mumbling something and eventually fell asleep for the second time.

"Thanks, Ronye-san, hometown missing illness it is."

After waving her hand a little towards Ronye on the gallery, Asuna kept explaining.

"So, as Oroi-san is falling under that hometown missing illness, I will say I would want to get him out of here in two-three days. I hope the case will be resolved by then..."

"Within three days, it will be difficult, don’t you think? It will take two weeks one way, no matter how rushed, to get response from Obsidia."

The words of Fanatio were supplemented by Kirito.

"Also, due to the investigation the number of days is **increm**...... will be added<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>. Not only must we wait for Scheta's report, but we should check what can be investigated here..."

"Even you say so, the dagger that killed old Yazen has disappeared, right? There are no witnesses of the incident, there is no motive for victim to be killed, so it indeed stalled like this."

Entokia's tone was light, but the meaning of his phrase had grim weight, everyone has been silent again.

A few seconds later, the one who raised her hand, was a person keeping silent until now, just like Asuna.

A woman was wearing a neat white robe; her brown hair had been made into a single tight braid. Her name was Ayuha Furia, a girl who at such a young age has already been selected as the head of the Axiom Church Sacred Art department.

The Sacred Art department, formerly known as the Monks Order, supervised the Church organization of the entire Human World. There always were its branch offices in the center of all the cities and villages, with Sacred Arts practitioners called "**Brother**" or "**Sister**" in the sacred language, which had voices greater than or equal to those of village heads and town mayors in the area, and higher ranked priests used their sacred power to supervise lower ones.

In particular, when the four senior priests who supervised the monks, which in certain circumstances were said to exercise the power of senior nobility or even higher, were asked by knight chief Bercouli to go participate in the defense battle by the Great Eastern Gate, all four of them declined. Most of the approximately 300 monks who participated in the Human World Defense Army were low- or middle-grade Arts Masters, with only one hundred higher level Arts Masters who were good at attacking techniques, and it seemed that almost all of the priest-class monks tried as much as they can to not to leave the Cathedral.

Immediately after the Foreign World War was over and the Human World Union Council was established, it was discovered that all four senior priests had accumulated a vast property in private rooms, and they were expelled from Central Cathedral. The monk system itself was also reorganized into a Sacred Art Division and Ayuha Furia, 5th class aristocrat was chosen as its first president.

Ayuha joined not only the battle by the Great Eastern Gate but also Human World Defense Force division troops and fought to the last as a leader of the clerics. Ronye, who was in the same unit, remembered her appearance keeping chanting healing techniques as her white robe gradually becoming dyed red with the blood of the injured. Even though her skill did not reach the senior Integrity Knights level, her knowledge of the Art and the medium usage was outstanding and she was more serious and friendly than anyone around.

If Ronye learns Sacred Art, it is better from Ayuha...... she have always thought, but unfortunately, the second teacher was Ayuha's younger sister, Sacred Art teacher Sones Furia who was also the librarian of the newly created large library, and was truly strict person. Vice-Prime Swordsman also received lectures by Sones, and even though she didn’t shake like the majority of others, Asuna sometimes grumbled regarding the matter.

Sones was also eligible to participate in this conference, but she did not come out of the big library unless there was a good reason. *I do not know what will happen unless I realize the technique that the librarian of the previous generation incorporated into the room as soon as possible......* she used to say, but at that moment the understanding was not yet achieved.

Fanatio welcomed Ayuha who was raising her hand, and she said in a calm voice.

"For that matter, the Sacred Art Department may be able to cooperate a bit."

"Oh... what do you mean?"

"For some time, I have been conducting the analysis of the technique that was used by the "Automated Elders Council" that was created to detect Taboo Index violators...... Apparently, that merciful old men seemed to be able to not only quickly find those who violated the Taboo Index but also to go back to the past to some extent."

"To the past……?"

It wasn’t only Fanatio who muttered that, other knights and departments heads also looked surprised.

Meanwhile, Kirito leaned ahead making rattling noise and asked quickly.

"Wa…wait a minute...... That means that the server's log... that you can reproduce the events that happened in the past, like reflection? No way... No, but is it impossible? ...Even if the system detects a Taboo Index violation and opens the window at that point, the violation itself is already complete. If they couldn’t see the past, could they actually check what was done? ── How many days will the operation be traced back to the past?"

"In the present situation it is difficult to go back even for one day, Prime Swordsman-sama. I tried the operation incantation, but the load was too big, the limit was to go back 30 minutes. I wish I could use the technique of viewing the past just after the incident occurred, but it was yesterday that the documentation was discovered..."

When Ayuha replied with a miserable tone, Kirito folded his arms with a complicated expression.

Vice-Prime Swordsman began talking instead of him, looking somewhat interested.

"Ayuha-san, you mentioned earlier that "the load of the operation is too big", but what exactly is it like?"

"See, it is difficult to explain precisely with words...... It is a feeling that a rich amount of sound and light flows in your head, it becomes difficult to keep concentrating on only the target scene from among everything else. In addition, once one uses past reflection technique they get exhausted to the limit...... I think it is possible to reassemble it into a more efficient art, but it will take some time."

"I see... Thank you, Ayuha-san"

When Asuna thanked her, the head of the Sacred Art department nodded with an embarrassed expression.

Unlike Integrity Knights, Sacred Art teacher did not have her life frozen. Therefore, Ayuha looked exactly like her age suggested — presumably, she was probably about 22 or 23 years old, but in rare cases when such expression appeared, she began to appear younger than her sister librarian Sones.

*Or it might be because Sones’ expression is too rigid......* thought Ronye, but at that moment Prime Swordsman's voice was heard again.

"── Director Furia, I would like to continue the analysis of the past reflection art, and I will also ask you to extend it within reasonable bounds. As for **care** of Oroi, I would like to communicate with his companions who are staying in a south Centoria inn, by inviting them to the Cathedral. I will consult with the chef, so that meals can be brought close to the taste of their homeland as much as possible."

The attendees at the conference as well as Ronye and Tiese were gradually becoming more comfortable with the unfamiliar sacred words that sometimes mix with the speech of Kirito and Asuna. "**Care**" was something about being concerned of someone else, in the sense of looking after and providing for the needs of; it was certainly quicker to be able to express it with only two letters.

"Such a task, can be delegated to us......."

A 40-year-old man with square eyeglasses serving as the Director of the Cathedral Materials Management Department sprang up, but Kirito quickly shook his head.

"No, it is because I had meals with them in the field on numerous occasions...... It will take time to learn the same from scratch."

The director who probably have never left Human World had no choice but to withdraw his suggestion.

Mountain Goblin ration had little dry wheat which was barely growing at the foot of the mountains, and mainly consisted of tree nuts and wild grasses collected in the wilderness; sneaky iwanezumi or yoroimas that can be fished at Tanigawa are already considered the feast<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>. It must be difficult to reproduce such a dish in Centoria, but there was no choice but to believe in the chef's mastery.

With the last words of Kirito, the topic seemed to be concluded, and Ayuha raised again.

"Next, let me report about the replenishment of the Sacred Art division's staff."

"So, you have finally finished the selection, took quite some effort...... please go ahead."

When Fanatio encouraged her, the head of the division bowed and took a bunch of white hemp paper.

"── Currently, the Sacred Art Division is the total of 352 people including apprentices, is still short of staff if we compare to 500 people before the Foreign World War. In order to realize an early stage of ongoing "clerical expansion plan", we need to urgently to raise the number people. For now, we have recruited thirty apprentice clerics in February..."

"Wait a minute."

The one who interrupted was Entokia who was eating cake with a cup of tea from the table. Ronye and Tiese knew that that day's sweets were exotic treats called "macaron"<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> because they helped Vice-Prime Asuna who made them in the kitchen with her own hands, and Entokia seems to like it very much.

The short-haired knight put the halfway bitten pale-pink macaroon baked with the juice of hayamomo<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> and then continued.

"There are no complaints about increasing the number of apprentices, but will it not take years to get them into a fledged state? Then, perhaps you can consider recalling those who left Cathedral? Those guys will soon have their head cooled down."

Entokia's proposal caused not only people around the table to gaze around, but also Ronye and Tiese exchanged looks.

Certainly, after four senior priests were expelled, nearly one hundred clerics have left Cathedral following them. Most of those were ones who refused to participate in the Human World Defense Army, so Ronye secretly thought "It’s for the best" in her mind, but regardless of their personality, they were no doubt the finest professionals of Human World. If one hundred people would come back, the shortage of personnel of Sacred Art Division would be eliminated at once.

"Umm…."

After producing this long groaning, Kirito turned his face to the person sitting in the corner of the round table. No, since the round table is perfectly circular, there should be no corners and edges, but only the place where that person sat was always dull and it felt like it is by all means a corner.

"Xiao-san, do we know what do those Arts masters who left the Axiom Church do afterwards?"

It was a small woman in simple brown and gray clothes whom Prime Swordsman asked for an opinion. Her name was Xiao Shukas, Director of the Cathedral Information Department.

The Information Department was a bureau newly established after the proclamation of the Human World Union Council, and its main role was to gather information that the Elders Council used to hold once. However, even though there were still few people, Ronye couldn’t still grasp exactly what kind of person director Xiao was.

Xiao whose dark brown hair was cut short to the limit women could afford seemed to whisper, but...... a sound of the strange voice she answered in reached Ronye standing on the gallery.

"Although I could not trace all the clerics, most of them asked for work in various Church branches throughout Human World. Another case would be to become a teacher in a big city school; as a rare example, if one finds a wealthy supporter, the option to open their own prayer room becomes... feasible."

Her weak intonation did not radiate the power of the knights, but girl knights Linel and Fizel seemed to fly around with instructions given by Xiao. Ronye has no idea how it could have possibly come to such a command structure.

"Hmm...... it gives an impression of surprisingly legitimate and appropriate way of reemployment......."

Xiao slightly nodded to Kirito’s words.

"But we could grasp just about 70% of the clerics who left Cathedral; at the same time to discover where the remaining 30% are now and what they are doing using the current investigation procedures appears... impossible."

"Okay...... Thank you, I will consider the increase of information agencies as well. Regarding Entokia-san's **idea**, I think it is too early to approach them right now. It would still be perceived wrong... but, in line with the "clerical expansion plan" we may consider cooperation with those arts masters who are working at church branches or at schools. ── Director Furia, I am sorry we had to interrupt you. Please continue. "

"Well then ..."

Hurriedly finishing a macaron which she began to chew while Xiao was speaking with a gulp of tea, Ayuha dropped her eyes again.

"Er, there are 30 apprentices who are planning to enter the Tower by the end of this month, including 29 people from Centoria city and 1 from outside. Here’s the list......"

After lightly coughing, Ayuha began enumerating the names of young people newly allowed through the gates of Cathedral with glossy beautiful voice.

In the days when the Highest Priest ruled, for those who wanted to become a Chalk Tower resident, regardless of whether they were aristocrats or the general people, there was no other choice but to win the Four Empires Unified Martial Arts Contest. And even that well-deserved honor was erased by the "Synthesis ritual".

Then, where the monks, nuns and priests other than the knights came from? The majority were those born and raised in the Church. Except for, when parents love each other, they are blessed with a baby...... but the Highest Priest Administrator screened outstanding talents and personalities of the monks and ordered the men and women who held them to have kids.

In other words, most of the monks were born and grew up in Cathedral, and Ronye had a strange admiration of those who chose to work outside the tower, but unlike Integrity Knight, monks have long had opportunities to learn about the life of the general population by going out to the town to visit branches and buy supplies.

But after the death of the Highest Priest, of course, no child was ordered to be born, so even if all the children up to the age of 12 who are currently raised in the Cathedral become cleric apprentices, the number of Sacred Arts Division personnel will not continue to increase. Moreover, it is not certain whether the children given the unlimited freedom of choice will decide to go that way.

Therefore, it is essential to replenish the number of Sacred Art Masters, inviting those who left the Tower, especially due to their outstanding talent grown during the Administrator era — even if it has been a forced development ─ and it seemed that Ayuha Furia who became the head of the Sacred Art Division considered that kind of circumstances as well.

While thinking so, Ronye vaguely continued to listen to the names read aloud.

"...... in total, six people from Western Centoria. Next are five people who are accepted from Northern Centoria. Of the Northern Centoria episcopate, **brother** apprentice, Ihar Dhalik, 13 years old... also **brother** apprentice, Maxiom Toulzer, 14 years old...... **sister** apprentice, Lenon Shimki, 13 years old, **sister** apprentice......."

"After all they are mostly children of the Church."

To Tiese's whispers, Ronye answered "That's true". However, the moment she heard the read-out name of the fifth person from North Centoria, she forgot what she was going to say.

"....... and Elite Swordsman-in-Training of Northern Centoria Sword Mastery Academy, Frenica Szeski, 17 years old."

"E...... Eeeeee ────────!?"x2

As soon as the two of them shouted aloud, little Berchie in Tiese's arms opened both eyes. Large tear-drops accumulated in the corners of blue eyes and as if water has broken through a dam, the boy erupted with an outrageous cry.

Although they immediately lowered their head to hide from the conference hall and subsequently nursed Berchie, they could not stop exchanging happy looks over and over again.

Both of them had a wide smile on their faces. _I'd like to talk to Tiese now, but I have to endure it until the meeting ends._

The head of the Sacred Arts Department Ayuha, who was interrupted by the screams of those two, gently coughed and resumed reading.

"Er, in total, 5 people from Northern Centoria. And finally, one from outside of the city...... from Norlangarth Northern Empire Northern Marginal Area, **sister** apprentice from Rulid village branch, Selka Zuberg, 15 years old."

"E...... Eeeeee ────────!?"

It was not Ronye or Tiese who screamed.

It was someone who was sitting at the round table and until that moment listening to a report with a face bearing a trace of drowsiness, someone entitled Prime Swordsman.
