# Part 1

"Unforgi…!"

Such word jumped out of her throat the moment her back felt the shock.

She pulled away a cloth clinging to her face and after some struggling in the darkness she noticed that this was her bedroom. Apparently, she had just fallen from the bed.

It was still dark outside the window. She faintly grabbed the blanket and climbed back onto the bed.

It was late February, and every day it felt that it’s getting warmer, but it was still cool before dawn. _I wish Central Cathedral would have a hot water heating device like Obsidia in the Dark Territory_, she thought...... then firmly wrapped the blanket around and let out a brief breath.

Ronye did not normally have problems with sleep — it was probably because she had been dreaming of that day that she moved so hard that she has fell to the floor. She used to forget the content as soon as she woke up, but that night's dream still remained in her head.

After the end of a Foreign World War, they returned to the central capital in mid-November 380th of the Human World calendar. In December the Human World Union Council was launched and it was only a February of 381th when the Rebellion of Four Empires broke out so it was just a year ago when Ronye and Tiese had crossed swords with the Northern Empire’s, Krueger Norlangarth.

_Maybe it is because of that dream, and why do people need to have dreams in the first place……_ but even though she was waiting for sleeping fairies to come again, her eyelids did not get heavy. She laid still for about three minutes, then the bells outside of the window delivered a subdued 5 AM tone, so she gave up and set on the bed.

She got feet down to the floor, threw over a thick woolen shawl and reached for the table lamp. Turning a large screw in the middle of the barrel, she let water filling the glass-made burner to flow down to the lower container, and the egg-sized piece of ore contained in the burner ignited by itself and release the soft yellow light.

Before they returned home from Dark Territory two days ago, Kirito had packed ten more ore lamps, exclusive Obsidia produce, into the luggage compartment of the dragon, to give them as a souvenir to everyone. Ronye and Tiese also got one each, and got used to them immediately, since to ignite it was enough just to drop the water level, and extinguishing was also very easy —just to turn the lamp upside down to return water to the burner; besides, it was much cheaper compared to conventional oil lamps, and even to light element lamps used in Cathedral, as it was unnecessary to generate an element.

Of course, ore — it seems locals called the stone Luminolite — would not continue to burn indefinitely, if one keeps the fire constantly on, it burns out in about four days. In other words, although Ronye and others could use this lamp at will, one would think it will become a waste if in one-month time, but Kirito seemed to want to import large quantities of luminous stone from the Dark Territory.

Since it begins to burn without permission unless it is submerged in a certain amount of water, a certain skill is necessary to carry it a long distance, so if this becomes stable, the night of Centoria will become even brighter, likewise Obsidia's situation with continued refugees' influx and work being hard to find is also somewhat aided.

Nonetheless, the situation in the Dark Territory could not be improved with just ore. Although Kirito was trying to solve the fundamental problem that the fertility and sunlight amount is insufficient to harvest agricultural crops enough for it’s population, it seems that he has not yet reached any result.

Under such circumstances, Kirito is committing the greatest hope to the other side of the "end wall of the world" that surrounds all Underworld, but there are many problems here as well. _Will a machine dragon be able to really exceed an infinite cliff that could never be overcame by a living thing.... and even if it does, I there a new ground spreading beyond that wall, or only pure "emptiness" lays beyond?_

"............ Still......."

After thinking this way for a moment, Ronye shut this burden in her heart and moved again.

She lifted a long sword, placed in a sheath of black leather from the stand beside the chest of drawers. Then she took out a small wooden box from a drawer and returned to the table.

This sword, having silvery shining guard reminiscent of the crescent moon and the handle wrapped with the same black leather as the sheath, was given to her five days ago by the Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna. It had Priority 39, which is too much for knight trainee, even though it does not qualify to the Divine Object class.

The blade she gently pulled out of the sheath gleamed faintly in the light of the ore lamp, but there was a small scratch on a part of it. It was when she slashed the left arm of a black robe man who kidnapped Lisetta, daughter of general commander Isukan and ambassador Scheta, at the top floor of Obsidia castle.

The sword's life itself was already recovered because it was contained in the sheath for two days, but dirt and scratches would not disappear without care.

She put the sword on the table and opened the wooden box. First, she removed the dirt by wiping the blades, guard and handle with white cotton cloth. Then poured some polishing oil on the leather of the Silver-Fur Deer of Southern Empire and polished the blade carefully.

Kirito and Yujio during the time of Sword Mastery Academy frequently talked about taking care of swords while handling the Sword of the Night Sky and the Sword of the Blue Rose. Ronye was fond of watching them closely at that times. She still felt that one and a half months Tiese and herself were doing a valet duty was the most enjoyable and most brilliant days of her 17 years life.

_As the Foreign World War and the Rebellion of the Four Empires concluded, and peace has returned to life in Cathedral, I certainly find it enjoyable. Although sword skill, sacred art and incarnation trainings are difficult, I sincerely wish these days to last forever. But every time I realize that Tiese's face or Kirito's profile may eventually fade away, Yujio will not be able to return anymore... and I am conscious of how important his existence was.  
Kirito and Yujio, Ronye and Tiese. How precious was the time spent by four of us, can it be compared to anything at all? But it is lost forever, never to return.  
............ No.  
Perhaps, it is not only because of Yujio that I feel this way._

It could be due to unlike Tiese's love, Ronye’s own feelings will never be rewarded anymore, and everything around kept reminding her of this.......

"Ah……"

She accidentally slid her hand and the blade brushed the belly of her thumb. When she put the sword away and looked at her fingertips, there was little pain, but a blood bead emerged from the shallow cut.

Ronye lowered her left hand which lifted reflexively to produce a light element. She put the thumb against her lips and traced the cut with the tongue. Blood ceased immediately, but it will take some time for the wound to disappear. _But this shall be an admonition to myself who thought too much while handling the sword._

She ended wiping the blade with oily leather, finished with a soft cloth to remove any tarnish and returned the sword to the sheath.

From now on she must little by little deepen the binding with her new love sword she just has named the "Sword of the Moonlight". By the time she will be able to fully use this sword she surely had to organize the feelings she had.

She got up and returned the sword and care equipment to the chest of drawers, shawl was thrown to the bed and the night dress swiftly followed. That moment she suddenly shivered and let out one small sneeze.

_Why do people sneeze? Let's ask Kirito along with reasons for dreaming next time..._ Ronye hurried to the cupboard where the knight clothes were hung out.

***

23<sup>rd</sup> February, 380 by Human World calendar.

The cold rain that began before dawn was pouring over large glass windows of the Cathedral’s fiftieth floor called the "Great Corridor of Spiritual Light".

In this hall, which was named the large corridor, there was a handrailed gallery around the high wall. Ronye and Tiese went up there and watched the state of the conference proceeding before their eyes.

Why in the corridor, not by the round table, — it was because Berchie whom Fanatio entrusted to them was in a relatively high spirit if he was taken to some high location. Certainly, the fiftieth floor itself was more than two hundred mels away from the ground, but it was separated by thick walls and solid glass, so it seemed that a one year old child could not feel the height.

"Hey Ronye, you saw Scheta-san's baby at Obsidia, right?"

Tiese whispered while slowly rocking sleeping Berchie.

"Yeah, I also gave her **milk**."

"Wish I was there. She should be about three months old, I guess, she’s so cute?"

"Much more than that. She already had hair and it was quite fluffy, her eyes were bright are on top of that..."

Hearing words of Ronye, Tiese got entranced and gazed straight without focusing on anything.

"This… Beru-boy is also cute when sleeping, but boys and girls are different, are they not? I wonder if Scheta-san brings her next time she comes home..."

_Probably_, — Ronye was ready to answer but swallowed the word.

Ronye had not told her best friend yet that Lisetta, the daughter of Scheta and Isukan, was kidnapped for about half a day. It was so because Kirito reminded her not to tell anyone until reporting at today's meeting, but the question or discomfort associated with that secret between two of them only increased rather than dissolving even after several days.

_I can understand why kidnappers targeted Lisetta. If one aims to intimidate Kirito, there will not be any hostage more effective than Lisa. A Vice-Prime Swordsman Asuna, perhaps, but I do not believe there’s a villain capable of kidnapping her exists at present in Underworld._

On the other hand, the method was quite mysterious.

They invaded near the top floor of the Obsidia Castle, which is severely guarded and is located at a height of as much as five hundred mels, although it does not exceed the Cathedral; moreover, after kidnapping Lisetta, it was the fiftieth floor that could not be unlocked — where they opened a window by the throne and hid in there. After being uncovered by Kirito's actions, even after Ronye slashed his left arm off and he had to jump out of the window, a corpse could not be found.

Ronye certainly saw the gem hanging on the chest of the kidnappers glowing red when the window on the fiftieth floor opened. The general commander Isukan who heard it said that a similar stone had been fitted to the crown of Dark Territory Emperor Vector who died in the Foreign World War.

Isukan also speculated that the kidnapper belonged to assassin guild, but the guild seemed to have already been dismissed. Moreover, the artificial organism "minion" which the kidnapper used to confuse the guards of the castle is said to be produced only by the Dark Arts guild which is also remarkably weakened.

_What is going on in Dark Territory... and in Human World?  
Who are they and what are they trying to achieve...?_

"── all in all, that’s an outline of what happened at Obsidia Castle."

Suddenly, Kirito's voice echoing in the conference hall reached Ronye and brought her back from her thoughts.

Next to her, Tiese let our surprised voice:

"Eh...... you, were you involved in such a thing over there?"

Apparently, it seemed that Kirito had explained the same thing Ronye was tracing in her mind. She furtively glanced at the face of her best friend and nodded, shrugging:

"Well, yeah ... but, but it wasn’t especially dangerous there."

"It's quite dangerous, I guess, as you had to attack a guy who would kidnap a baby with the sword! That sounds as dangerous... it's almost as dangerous as instructor..."

"Should you had said such a thing back then at Academy, that would......"

As Ronye shook her head, the meeting in the hall went ahead.

"I do not want to complain about what happened, but Prime Swordsman-dono, I remember saying the same the other day! Every job has someone who makes a call!"

The owner of the thick voice reminiscent of a steel bow sound was Integrity Knight Dusolbert Synthesis Seven. Although, due to early morning time, instead of the usual red copper armor he wore Kimono of the eastern style, the severity of reprimand did not change.

"Obsidia Castle also has a number of guards, leave the gamble to them! Prime Swordsman now is the key to not just the Human World, yet all Underworld, if there is something happening to you, how much confusion will occur in both worlds should be understood!"

When Dusolbert closes his mouth, Fanatio Synthesis Two, the second generation knight leader who used to play the role of the one limiting him, said in a serious voice:

"I also agree with Dusolbert this time. Boy, I want you to understand that the era when the Prime took the sword himself and fought the enemy himself, is now over."

To these words, Renri Synthesis Twenty-Seven, who was also present, and all the heads of Cathedral departments, all nodded together.

Wearing black clothes Prime swordsman, who became a main point of the discussion instead of the meeting agenda, made a delicate face and attempted a counterattack from the northern side of the large circular table, with a tone that lacked profoundness.

"Well, I understand what everyone wants to say... but, you see, the previous knights leader Bercouli was flying voluntarily to the Mountain Range at the Edge and fighting dark knights, did he not? Even if I am given a managerial position of a Prime, I guess that one cannot earn trust only by sitting in a safe place after all..."

_── What he is saying is fine, but it sounds like a child's excuse when I hear something like this from Kirito-senpai._

Thought Ronye standing on the gallery ──

"The position of His Excellence Bercouli and your position of Prime Swordsman differ!"

A voice akin to the sharpened blade hit the hall, filling it entirely.

The speaker was a slender knight who did not participate in the meeting the other day.

His armor of an elegant design was pale green. Unusual dark green hair was long enough to touch the floor and hung on a chair, but that was a man. A long spear with the head covered with a pointed leather shell stood behind his back on the floor without any support.

A long-haired knight continued to shout looking at Kirito.

"His Excellency Bercouli continued his long fighting to protect Human World and Axiom Church by the order of her Holiness Highest Priest Administrator! But no one is granted the right to give orders to Prime Swordsman-dono...... hence I conclude that a duty for him is strictly to govern!"

Kirito attempted to refute lingering a little due to his language.

"Bu…but, if that's the reason, then I can command myself......"

The same moment the knight cracking his armor half-raised above the table.

But before even heavier scolding sounded, the current knight leader Fanatio suddenly interrupted.

"Please calm down a bit, Negi-boy."

"I am not green onion<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, it is Nergius!"

Although he had retorted indignantly, the knight named Nergius Synthesis Sixteen sat down suddenly calmed down. It was senior Integrity Knight who continued to protect the Axiom Church for over a hundred years.

According to the Human World naming principles, the name of Nergius was to welcome intelligence, resoluteness and virtuousness. However, hearing the owner of the Divine Object "Storm Sprout Spear", Ronye inclined to a more straightforward meaning of the name.

In a certain remote rural area of the Wesdarath West Empire, vegetables called Riko onions are said to be special products since long ago. Double as long as ordinary, with onions of triple thickness, and four times more sweet and delicious ─ at least this way they are advertised, but anyhow, once upon a time one farmer noticed that there are exceptionally tall Riko green onions growing in a corner of the field.

The delighted farmer carefully looked after it every day, to raise it even higher. The green onion grew steadily and quickly exceeded the length of 1 mel, reaching 2 mel.

Eventually rumors of haunted onion spread and many visitors gathered from nearby villages and towns. The farmer grew greedy, ceased harvesting the vegetable, but instead he understood that there was a way to get benefit and began to take coins from the onlookers wandering about the onion. Meanwhile the green onion grew to 3 mel, then to 4 mel and it’s thickness reached 50 cm. Originally supposed to be white, it got a silver metallic luster, and the green color of its leaves also increased vividness daily.

A few months passed, and the farmer noticed an abnormality in his own field. The young buds of newly seeded Rico onion did not grow up. Growth inferiority also affected the field of other people next door, eventually farmers in the village began to rumor that the cause of the anomaly is the haunted onion of which the farmer took care.

At last the gathering of the villagers ruled that the farmer had to dispose of onion. At that time, the farmer tried to pull out the onion which had reached seven mel in height. First, he tried to pull it out with a cow, but the onion did not bow at all, then he tried to cut it down with an ax, but the blade did not pass through. At the time he tried himself to dig out the root, the sky suddenly became cloudy and the fierce storm hit the village.

The wind and rain raged for quite a while, and when they finally fell, the farmer’s Riko onion field turned into a vast pool of mud, with the haunted onion growing lively in the middle ─

Nergius' Storm Sprout Spear is said to be converted by Highest Priest Administrator from haunted onion. Priority laid in the area of sacred treasures, but on top of that it had quite unusual special effect: it could stand untouched on the floor and the ground even if there was no support and it seemed that it never fell even if it was tilted.

It’s owner is similarly simple and single-minded person; it is without any doubt a noble knight who has been doing years of service for the Axiom Church, but Ronye did not have a very good impression of him. Because when the highest priest Administrator was defeated it was Nergius who insisted the most that Kirito must be executed as a rebel.

Although the immediate execution was avoided because the previous knight leader Bercouli persuaded the hardliners, they said that the knight Alice had to leave Centoria with Kirito. Moreover, the faction led by Nergius did not participate in a Foreign World War and remained in the defense of Cathedral and of the Mountain Range at the Edge, so even in that sense mental barrier between them was not thinner.

To calm himself, Nergius lifted a cup of tea provided to the round table and drank it with a breath. A new ─ but rather relaxed — voice flowed this time to a slightly relaxed atmosphere.

"Well, come to think of it, if Kirito-sensei does everything by himself, I feel a kind of loneliness as if I am not being trusted. Same here, Negio?"

Nergius who heard it stared at the right beside himself while holding an empty cup.

"I did not say anything about feeling lonely!"

Although he snapped back, there was no complain about the strange nickname of "Negio". It seemed though that he gave up, rather than accepted it.

The one who said that was a young knight of same age as Nergius — of course, judging by appearance. He was slightly taller than Nergius, and somewhat sturdier. His hair was cut short to two or three cen, color of his armor was purplish blue. He owned a classic long sword as a weapon and, of course, it was not standing on the floor by itself, but rather hung on the left hip.

His name was Entokia Synthesis Eighteen. He was also a senior knight, and he also has not participated in a Foreign World War. Like Nergius’, his face hasn’t been seen around for several months because they were in an expedition to the South Empire. It seemed to be about investigating whether one can pass the last tunnel that penetrates the mountain range that was buried long ago.

In response to Entokia's remark, Kirito, who seemed to be the second youngest in the hall after Renri, replied while stirring his black hair.
