# Part 2

"Ah...... that reaction was so wrong............"

Ronye, Tiese and Asuna smiled at the same time, looking at the Prime Swordsman who held his head with both hands and sighed deeply.

When the long meeting had finally finished, Ronye who returned little Berchie to Fanatio tried to head to the big dining room at the tenth floor to have lunch but was stopped by Asuna on the verge of rushing down the stairs. *How about lunch together?* Certainly, there was no reason to refuse if invited, and the two people immediately accepted it, so Vice-Prime Swordsman took them to the Central Cathedral’s Ninety-fifth floor, the "Watchtower of the Morning Star".

There were only pillars on the four sides of wind-blown platform, while most of the floor was a beautiful flower garden with a clean waterway, and at that time the floor was effectively the Cathedral’s top. The stairway rising to the ninety-sixth floor was sealed with an indestructible door created by Asuna with her divine power, and not only Integrity Knights but also Prime Swordsman Kirito could not pass through.

A white table was set in a corner of the garden, and Kirito who appeared three minutes later than the three people groaned in a miserable voice sitting on the chair. "That reaction" was, of course, the scream he let out as soon as he heard the name of Selka Zuberg.

Ronye and Tiese also exclaimed the moment the Frenica’s name was read aloud, but since they were friends with her at the first year at Sword Mastery Academy, it was not unnatural for two of them to be surprised.

But in the case of Kirito, the situation was somewhat... or rather, it was quite complicated.

Ronye and her friend have heard story of how Kirito and Yujio left the village Rulid of the Northern borderlands and survived a number of trials in the neighborhood to finally become Sword Mastery Academy's students, but that story was not disclosed in Cathedral.

Because the reason Kirito with his partner aimed at Centoria was to retrieve the golden Integrity Knight Alice Synthesis Thirty, who was born in Rulid village and has already become a legend, from Axiom Church.

In the present situation where many knights still believe the Highest Priest's tale that the Integrity Knight is an ambassador of gods summoned from the gods’ world, the information relating to "the Integrity Knight’s birthplace" must be kept in secret. In addition, it was Dusolbert Synthesis Seven who during his many years of service, that included the Human World Union Council, took young Alice from Rulid when she violated the Taboo Index, and he didn’t have memory of such event anymore. Dusolbert himself seemed to recognize the truth of "Synthesis ritual" to some extent, but considering young knights, he wouldn’t deliberately develop the topic.

Although Kirito explained that the reason why he was surprised with Selka Zuberg's name in the morning meeting was "Because it resembled a person who helped me way back", it wasn’t quite convincing and Fanatio and others did not appear to buy it immediately.

Asuna smiled and said in a comforting voice to Kirito who was keeping his head atop of the desk.

"Well, there's nothing you can do to it, Kirito-kun. When Selka-san reaches the Central Cathedral, everyone will understand that you know her."

"Oh yeah, but.... I wanted to prepare as much as possible before everyone starts questioning..."

"If you talk preparations, it probably worth having arranged that both you and Selka-san give identical impression, right? That’s what I was thinking about......."

"Ugh, makes sense......."

After Kirito nodded without trying to raise his face, Tiese expressed a slight hesitation:

"Um...... Kirito-senpai."

"What is it, Tiese?"

Prime Swordsman finally raised his head and looked at Tiese. And then her redhead best friend, after some more hesitation, said such a thing that surprised even Ronye.

"I think that it would be better to not to hide the truth anymore...... To explain Integrity Knights that they were born in Human World just like everyone else was."

"Wa-wait a sec, Tiese......."

Ronye hurriedly tried to block her best friend's words. "Synthesis ritual" of current Integrity Knights was the biggest secret of the Human World Union Council, and that’s why she did not think that it was a good thing for an apprentice knight to say.

But Kirito waved his hand to stop Ronye, then smiled and looked at Tiese again.

"Yeah, I also basically agree. Summoned from the gods’ world...... there are too many reasons for that fairy tale to come out as senseless. Among the old knights, Fanatio-san and Dusolbert-san, perhaps Scheta-san all have noticed the truth to a considerable extent already, and one day...... no, as soon as possible, I think I have to explain the real thing to all Integrity Knights.………… However……"

Having said that, Kirito hesitated for a moment having a look like he is worrying for Ronye and the other one.

"...... Sorry, I am about to recollect the bad things... but both of you remember, right? The last moments of Raios Antinous'..."

As soon as they heard that name, Ronye and Tiese sitting side by side both froze on the spot.

Two of them could never forget it. Raios Antinous was an elite swordsman-in-training when they were valets of Kirito and Yujio. He treated his valet Frenica terribly, and when Ronye and Tiese protested about that case, he almost raped them, covering with the “aristocratic judgment” privilege given to the nobility.

Kirito and Yujio jumped into the room in a critical moment and saved the two of them, but Raios who lost both arms slashed by Kirito's blow, died in a strange way that still gave them shivers when the scene was remembered.

He did not lose the whole Life by massive bleeding. Rather, he let out a bizarre scream that cannot be thought of as a human’s one, then he collapsed on the floor as if the very soul of him had disappeared... and died. In the subsequent Foreign World War, Ronye and the other one witnessed many times people and sub-people losing their lives, but never have seen such a death.

When the two of them began to tremble badly, both Kirito and Asuna sitting across the table simultaneously leaned ahead, pulled the hands of Ronye and Tiese to the middle of the table and wrapped them firmly with their own hands. The hands of two humans who came to this world from the Real World were warmer than anyone else’s, and the cold wrapping Ronye quickly disappeared.

*Thank you very much*, she did not say these words but simply nodded, the two across nodded with a similar smile and returned to their seats. After breathing deeply, Ronye asked again.

"....... Is there a relationship between the last moments of elite swordsman-in-training Antinous and the Synthesis Ritual...?"

Kirito instantly shook his head.

"No, there is no direct relationship. But...... people who live in Underworld are can become like Raios when one's mind is subjected to extreme loads."

"Eh……"

Ronye and Tiese opened both eyes wide, but Kirito waved quickly again.

"You do not need to be afraid, you two are all right because that phenomenon only happens to those who are bound by a very rigid ideology."

"Rigid...... ideology?"

"Yeah, at that time, Raios put his Life on the scales against Taboo Index. For Raios who seemed to be made of self-esteem, his life should be given priority above everything else. But at the same time the Taboo Index is the absolute law that should not be violated no matter what happens. To violate the Taboo Index or to comply with the Taboo Index and die... neither of them could be chosen, and the Raios’ soul has collapsed."
