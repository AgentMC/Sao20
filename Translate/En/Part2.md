# Part 2

"Ah...... that reaction was so wrong............"

Ronye, Tiese and Asuna smiled at the same time, looking at the Prime Swordsman who held his head with both hands and sighed deeply.

When the long meeting had finally finished, Ronye who returned little Berchie to Fanatio tried to head to the big dining room at the tenth floor to have lunch but was stopped by Asuna on the verge of rushing down the stairs. *How about lunch together?* Certainly, there was no reason to refuse if invited, and the two people immediately accepted it, so Vice-Prime Swordsman took them to the Central Cathedral’s Ninety-fifth floor, the "Lookout of the Morning Star".

There were only pillars on the four sides of wind-blown platform, while most of the floor was a beautiful flower garden with a clean waterway, and at that time the floor was effectively the Cathedral’s top. The stairway rising to the ninety-sixth floor was sealed with an indestructible door created by Asuna with her divine power, and not only Integrity Knights but also Prime Swordsman Kirito could not pass through.

A white table was set in a corner of the garden, and Kirito who appeared three minutes later than the three people groaned in a miserable voice sitting on the chair. "That reaction" was, of course, the scream he let out as soon as he heard the name of Selka Zuberg.

Ronye and Tiese also exclaimed the moment the Frenica’s name was read aloud, but since they were friends with her at the first year at Sword Mastery Academy, it was not unnatural for two of them to be surprised.

But in the case of Kirito, the situation was somewhat... or rather, it was quite complicated.

Ronye and her friend have heard story of how Kirito and Yujio left the village Rulid of the Northern borderlands and survived a number of trials in the neighborhood to finally become Sword Mastery Academy's students, but that story was not disclosed in Cathedral.

Because the reason Kirito with his partner aimed at Centoria was to retrieve the golden Integrity Knight Alice Synthesis Thirty, who was born in Rulid village and has already become a legend, from Axiom Church.

In the present situation where many knights still believe the Highest Priest's tale that the Integrity Knight is an ambassador of gods summoned from the gods’ world, the information relating to "the Integrity Knight’s birthplace" must be kept in secret. In addition, it was Dusolbert Synthesis Seven who during his many years of service, that included the Human World Union Council, took young Alice from Rulid when she violated the Taboo Index, and he didn’t have memory of such event anymore. Dusolbert himself seemed to recognize the truth of "Synthesis ritual" to some extent, but considering young knights, he wouldn’t deliberately develop the topic.

Although Kirito explained that the reason why he was surprised with Selka Zuberg's name in the morning meeting was "Because it resembled a person who helped me way back", it wasn’t quite convincing and Fanatio and others did not appear to buy it immediately.

Asuna smiled and said in a comforting voice to Kirito who was keeping his head atop of the desk.

"Well, there's nothing you can do to it, Kirito-kun. When Selka-san reaches the Central Cathedral, everyone will understand that you know her."

"Oh yeah, but.... I wanted to prepare as much as possible before everyone starts questioning..."

"If you talk preparations, it probably worth having arranged that both you and Selka-san give identical impression, right? That’s what I was thinking about......."

"Ugh, makes sense......."

After Kirito nodded without trying to raise his face, Tiese expressed a slight hesitation:

"Um...... Kirito-senpai."

"What is it, Tiese?"

Prime Swordsman finally raised his head and looked at Tiese. And then her redhead best friend, after some more hesitation, said such a thing that surprised even Ronye.

"I think that it would be better to not to hide the truth anymore...... To explain Integrity Knights that they were born in Human World just like everyone else was."

"Wa-wait a sec, Tiese......."

Ronye hurriedly tried to block her best friend's words. "Synthesis ritual" of current Integrity Knights was the biggest secret of the Human World Union Council, and that’s why she did not think that it was a good thing for an apprentice knight to say.

But Kirito waved his hand to stop Ronye, then smiled and looked at Tiese again.

"Yeah, I also basically agree. Summoned from the gods’ world...... there are too many reasons for that fairy tale to come out as senseless. Among the old knights, Fanatio-san and Dusolbert-san, perhaps Scheta-san all have noticed the truth to a considerable extent already, and one day...... no, as soon as possible, I think I have to explain the real thing to all Integrity Knights.………… However……"

Having said that, Kirito hesitated for a moment having a look like he is worrying for Ronye and the other one.

"...... Sorry, I am about to recollect the bad things... but both of you remember, right? The last moments of Raios Antinous'..."

As soon as they heard that name, Ronye and Tiese sitting side by side both froze on the spot.

Two of them could never forget it. Raios Antinous was an elite swordsman-in-training when they were valets of Kirito and Yujio. He treated his valet Frenica terribly, and when Ronye and Tiese protested about that case, he almost raped them, covering with the “aristocratic judgment” privilege given to the nobility.

Kirito and Yujio jumped into the room in a critical moment and saved the two of them, but Raios who lost both arms slashed by Kirito's blow, died in a strange way that still gave them shivers when the scene was remembered.

He did not lose the whole Life by massive bleeding. Rather, he let out a bizarre scream that cannot be thought of as a human’s one, then he collapsed on the floor as if the very soul of him had disappeared... and died. In the subsequent Foreign World War, Ronye and the other one witnessed many times people and sub-people losing their lives, but never have seen such a death.

When the two of them began to tremble badly, both Kirito and Asuna sitting across the table simultaneously leaned ahead, pulled the hands of Ronye and Tiese to the middle of the table and wrapped them firmly with their own hands. The hands of two humans who came to this world from the Real World were warmer than anyone else’s, and the cold wrapping Ronye quickly disappeared.

*Thank you very much*, she did not say these words but simply nodded, the two across nodded with a similar smile and returned to their seats. After breathing deeply, Ronye asked again.

"....... Is there a relationship between the last moments of elite swordsman-in-training Antinous and the Synthesis Ritual...?"

Kirito instantly shook his head.

"No, there is no direct relationship. But...... people who live in Underworld are can become like Raios when one's mind is subjected to extreme loads."

"Eh……"

Ronye and Tiese opened both eyes wide, but Kirito waved quickly again.

"You do not need to be afraid, you two are all right because that phenomenon only happens to those who are bound by a very rigid ideology."

"Rigid...... ideology?"

"Yeah, at that time, Raios put his Life on the scales against Taboo Index. For Raios who seemed to be made of self-esteem, his life should be given priority above everything else. But at the same time the Taboo Index is the absolute law that should not be violated no matter what happens. To violate the Taboo Index or to comply with the Taboo Index and die... neither of them could be chosen, and the Raios’ soul has collapsed."

When Kirito became silent, Asuna who would have already heard that story also had a look of mixed fear and resentment. Kirito kept on talking after lightly touching the hands of Asuna laying on the table.

"Besides, there is a story I heard from Fanatio, that in the defense battle by the Great Eastern Gate even the giants’ former chief lost his mind and then screamed the same way like Raios. The giants tend to stabilize themselves by believing that they are the strongest among all the races... I think that stereotype was about to be destroyed and he had gone mad. The problem... perhaps, for some Integrity Knights, believing that they were summoned from gods’ world may be the foundation of their soul of equal importance."

For Ronye who witnessed the strength and the nobility of Integrity Knights every day, Kirito's fearful words gave totally perplexed feeling.

Of course, the fact that everything about "Synthesis ritual" is lies — the fact that the Highest Priest Administrator had deceived all Integrity Knights, would mean terrible shock to them.

But knights, fearless, depending on nobody but themselves, they can endure even that. Not like Raios Antinous, they won’t let their soul collapse.

Or was this just a wish? Even after becoming a knight apprentice, Ronye continued embracing heartfelt respect and admiration for Integrity Knights even when it came to talking about Incarnation and teaching sword skills and Sacred Art on a daily basis. She wanted them to be an absolute existence that cannot be hurt by anything ─ this way she felt, but was this really the truth...?

Ronye, deeply depressed, heard a trembling voice of Asuna.

"Hey, Kirito-kun. I wondered for a moment... Taboo Index is absolute for people of Human World, is it not? So that just as one tries to break it, their soul would collapse."

"Ah... not really. Usually, the ‘Seal of the right eye’ will be activated before the soul collapses, and they will not be able to continue thinking of violation.... The reason why the seal did not activate for Raios was that he never tried to commit an offense but acted from an absolute confidence, I think because of that he fell into a **loop** of choosing between two taboos, that he must protect both Taboo Index and his life."

"Senpai, what is ‘**loop**’?"

It was Tiese who interrupted. Kirito answered with a sort of embarrassed expression.

"Even though I've planned to be careful, somehow **Eng**... a sacred word came out. Loop is ring, or something of that shape, it included the meaning of "never-ending" or "repeating"...... Good explanation?"

Kirito gazed at Asuna who smiled and nodded.

"I think it was pretty good, the remaining meanings would be "to tie up" or "to wind around"<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>.

"Uhu, uhu, thank you very much!"

Having thanked him, Tiese took out of a compartment of her uniform ─ there was a sacred word for it, seemingly "pocket" ─ a small square book of white hemp paper bundled with yarn threads and a copper pen. She quickly turned over sheets of paper already filled with small letters and arrived at a blank sheet, where she wrote the meaning of "loop".

"Wai... wait, Tiese, what's that?"

"He-he, I got paper scraps at the management department and made it. If I write it down this way, I will not forget the sacred words that you have taught us."

"Se… secretly, such a thing..."

Ronye panicked a little to the surprising acumen and effort of Tiese who was supposed to hate studying even more than herself. She poked the flank of her best friend and whispered.

"Please tell me how to make one later."

"Hu-hu-hu, you know I occasionally want to eat a honey pie from the ‘Jumping Deer’ pavilion."

"I understand, surely..."

Kirito watching the exchange between the two of them leaned against the backrest and said:

"Well, I hope the system will allow us to increase the production of white hemp. I want three harvests now… or even five ones."

"Even tenfold would not be even closely enough."

Suddenly added Asuna.

"Ideally, everyone in Human World...... no, in all Underworld should be able to use notebooks and copper pens freely."

"That would be great if that happened..."

Said Tiese who seemed to have unexpectedly recognized the pleasure of studying, staring at her small book.

"Since parchment is so expensive, children of lower classes like me and Ronye wrote in water-soluble lotus leaves ink, then washed it away and reused over and over. The regular paper made by hitting White-thread grass is cheap, but in just one week it’s life is exhausted and it will crumble.... I think that any child will love to learn if this white paper becomes available for free."

"Well, afterwards I hope to make as many textbooks as possible..."

Ronye also nodded deeply this time to Asuna's words.

For a while Kirito was flying around the Human World to find the material for the paper which would combine the durability of parchment paper and the accessibility of regular paper. Finally, he found snow-white hemp, a pure white plant growing only on the rocky mountain in the northwestern part of the Northern Empire. Cutting its leaves and stems finely and stewing in a large pan, and when ready, pouring the thin layer of a goo over a flat surface, and before it’s Life begins to decrease, drying with thermal and aerial elements to change its current state from low-durability “plate” to high-durability “cloth”, and then rolling a large rolling pin many times over it to finish and smooth it — this way one can make white paper.

It was much cheaper than parchment only sixty cen of which can be made from a single sheep and its durability is high enough to compete with parchment, but it took more effort than regular paper, which is made by knitting White-thread grass vertically and horizontally and then hitting it with a mallet, and the material, snow-white hemp, was not available around the central capital. At that time, a field of snow-white hemp has been opened in the rocky production area, four manufactures were also completed in Centoria, and sales of white hemp paper for the residents of the central capital has been started, but it still was higher priced than the regular paper. Even new to that all Ronye understood how hard it was to make this a cheap produce for children of Dark Territory as well as Human World.

However, for Kirito and Asuna the mass production of white hemp was not the final goal. It seemed that they wanted to make a massive number of textbooks in which Human World languages, mathematics, and methods of learning techniques would be described.

"...... If textbooks get distributed to one person each, children can study at any time..."

It was Tiese who took over Ronye's words.

"Even for the textbook of the elementary Sacred Art, they say, it takes skillful craftsman a month to copy a single book. Of course, it is very expensive...... My father bought a textbook because Sacred Art was an entrance exam subject of Sword Mastery Academy, still it was only possible to buy an early copy where characters had lost their shapes, which seemed to be a terrible regret. It is still my treasure."

Actually, Ronye shared the same experience.

The highest-class books at Human World, textbooks carefully copied with the same "axiom typeface" as used in the Taboo Index, were priced at more than 1 million shears, and lower-ranking aristocrats could not buy it, not to mention ordinary people. So-called "quick-copy" textbooks, appearing if a young craftsman copied it with some misshaped letters, would fall in price much, but it was still elite shopping.

"This is something to take care of. Then, someday..."

Kirito said that while smiling, then he paused and heavily sighed.

"...... Mass production of textbooks will be many times harder than white hemp paper, but well, we’ll take care of it patiently, because there is plenty of time..."

"...That's right."

Asuna nodded with a somewhat mischievous smile.

"So, Kirito-kun, it was not only the sword skill but also the Sacred art test, when you took the entrance exams of Sword Mastery Academy."

"Ah, that, I was among the top twelve...... I wish I could say. But I learned Sacred Art from Yujio fervently supervising that I learn only stuff I should."

When hearing that, Tiese smiled and chuckled. However, her laughter seemed to include emotions other than joy, and Ronye could only slightly open her mouth, without saying a word.

Asuna who has a consoling smiling smile, looked at the blue sky visible between the columns and an expression of vexation blinked across her face.

"Anyway, both of you are probably hungry. Let’s have lunch, can you help me to carry it?"

Of course, Kirito also got upright immediately as Ronye and Tiese who stood up at the same time. From the time she was his valet, Ronye always said "Let me do it" at such times, but even at that time Kirito would not sit down and wait for service. *Senpai really did not change*... as she was thinking so walking behind Asuna, Tiese took out the pen and the notebook again and said:

"So, Asuna-sama, ‘notebook’ is some sort of book for records?"

**Grrr** — it was Ronye who could not help clenching her fists.

***

On the first floor beneath the "Lookout of the Morning Star", on the ninety-fourth floor of the Cathedral, there was a kitchen, not as wide as the large kitchen on the tenth floor, but convenient and a well-equipped one.

As soon as Asuna opened the double door, the sweet scent of honey and the fragrant aroma of burned cheese stroke her, and the Ronye’s stomach shrunk tightly.

The kitchen was built with marble floor and white ceiling, there were many tall cupboards on the walls on three sides, brightening its appearance with the variety of tightly packed ingredients and colorful vases and bottles. On the remaining wall there was a shelf with cooking utensils and a large furnace; a large white wooden workbench was placed in the center of the wide room.

As four people entered the kitchen, a slender figure behind the workbench lifted the head.

It was a young woman wearing a white cook’s coat with no stain on it and a cylindrical hat above the short hair. To be exact, she should be referred to as 'very young'.

The woman who was sitting on a chair and grinding a large kitchen knife stood up looking at Ronye and others. Briefly bowed to Asuna, she said:

"Asuna-sama, I left it wrapped in the oven to keep it warm. Salad and bread will be there as well."

"Thank you, Hana, I am sorry to be late."

Asuna, after saying the apology, walked up to a large hot oven set on the wall at the back of the kitchen. This cooking utensil, which burns the fire under the tightly sealed box made of stone and bricks and heats the contents equally, was called "**tenpi**" in Human World language, to distinguish it from "**tenpi**" meaning the light of Solus, it was more common to call it an **oven** in the Common Sacred Language.<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>

Of course, both **salad** and **bread** were common sacred words too, so this time Tiese did not took the notebook out.

Asuna, who opened the door of the oven after fitting thick leather gloves, pulled out a large container with lid from inside. The container seemed to emit the smell of cheese.

Speaking of what enclosed the cooking, it was a simple shallow pot used to cook various ingredients in a flour dough baked around them, but it was unheard that someone will be cooking by putting such a pot in the oven. In the first place the oven was used for baking bread. With the look of excitement, Asuna moved the elliptical container to the workbench, and carefully removed the lid.

"Wow, wha… what is... this ...?"

It was Tiese who said this loudly. Ronye also bent her neck.

And then it appeared from the container, the edge burnt a little, white and thin, like a piece of paper....

"Hu-hu, this is a ‘paper wrapped bake’."

As Asuna proudly declared this, Ronye and Tiese opened their eyes wide with "Eeeh…".

"What, paper, real paper? White hemp paper......?"

Vice-Prime Swordsman nodded with a smile to this mistrustful question.

"I got some paper that was burned during the drying process from the paper plants of Cathedral and tried it."

"But, if you bake it in the oven, the paper will burn quickly, will it not?"

"It would burn if it is ordinary paper. I have not tried parchment, it’s too precious to be used in cooking. But white hemp paper, which as expected gained high durability, has properly fulfilled its duty."

As she said so, Asuna pulled the folded white hemp paper with her fingertips. It made a dry rustling sound but did not collapse. Despite being exposed to the high temperature of the heated oven, paper seemed to keep the Life intact.

While removing the leather gloves, Asuna continued:

"The cuisine of Human World...... of Underworld is simple, but it is ruled by strict laws. Whether you bake it or simmer, ‘food’ does not become ‘dish’ unless it is heated for a certain time or more. If there is not enough heating it gains the **status**...... it becomes ‘half-baked’ or ‘rare’ and the stomach will hurt if you eat it, and on the contrary if you heat too much, it becomes ‘burned’ and it will be hard and bitter."

"Y-yes......."

That was the first thing any girl learns has from her mother when she is taught cooking. *Rather than half-baked or burned, proper fire should be turned* ─ they listened to Asuna's words automatically remembering the saying from the past.

"The only problem is that the dish becomes the most delicious at the moment when it changes from ‘heating’ to ‘cooked’, right? It the heating continues, the more it goes on, the more it moisture gets lost, the dish gets harder, and the taste of ingredients dissolves out of stewed dishes as well. In the case of stewing, there is also a way to saturate the taste of the soup by continuing heating with a low heat while adding ingredients, but it takes too much time and trouble."

"Y-yes......."

As Ronye nodded again, the unique taste of the mysterious ‘Obsidia boil’ she ate in the capital city of Obsidia was about to revive in her mouth, so move quickly said:

"...... but, how is this related to paper used in cooking?"

"Well, at first, I tried to figure out the moment when the ingredients burned up, but Hana stopped me..."

When Asuna shifted her gaze, a white hat woman said without changing her expression:

"It is a trap that beginners and experts both fall every now and then. It wasn’t possible even for skilled chefs to figure out the perfect moment in hundreds of years. A long time ago, a person with an outstanding skill of determining, a chef called a genius of a kind being born once in one hundred years was invited to the Imperial Palace and cooked for the Emperor Norlangarth. Both the appetizer and the soup were masterpieces but the main dish, a big red-horned cow steak was taken from the fire only a moment earlier than needed. The emperor who ate it got stomachache and exercised aristocratic judgement privilege to cut off the cook’s arms."

While Ronye and Tiese stood speechless, Asuna shook away a shadow of sadness and said.

"... So, I decided to give up looking for the moment of baking and let it pass through as it is. But, instead I asked Hana if there is a way to retain the moisture even if one cooks it over time, and she told me that if you put it in a bowl with a lid and bake it in the oven, it will be somewhat different."

"Heeeh...... I also learned a variety of dishes, but I have never thought of such a recipe. You are truly an exclusive chef of the Highest Priest."

As Tiese showed her admiration, a woman named Hana shrugged her shoulders.

"It is in the past already. ── Anyway, you need hardware with high priority that cannot be broken even if heated in an oven, and even in this Cathedral oven baking is not perfect... instead of getting out freely, the water accumulates in the bowl and the dish gets half-braised and the taste of ingredients is diluted."

"So, at first, I tried traditional wrap, I wrapped the ingredients in dough, then put it in the bowl and baked it. But after all, the taste and moisture were gone out of the ingredient...... It was still OK if you eat it with the baked dough, but after all, the taste of the ingredient alone was bad. So, to preserve the moisture of the wrapped food from being lost, I was considering whether there is something that can resist heat, and eventually I came up with this white paper."

"Heeeh....... So, that’s what you mean by a ‘paper wrapped bake’?"

Ronye muttered that while staring at the contents of the vessel.

"So, is it now that you are going to unwrap it...?"

It was Prime Swordsman who had been silent till now who said that with a faint miserable voice. Apparently, he endured the hunger but the limit seems to have come.

Asuna giggled and picked the slightly scorched edge of paper with slender fingers.

"Actually, today is the first time to try. So if it fails you can only have salad and bread for lunch, sorry for that."

"E-eeeh?!"

That exclamation came not only from Kirito but also Tiese. Of course, Ronye felt the same as well. While watching Asuna's hand, she prayed to the goddess of earth Terraria who also controlled the food.

The paper unfolded from all sides one by one, and as soon as it was opened on the left and right, Ronye felt an incredibly saturated mellow aroma spreading all around.

The main ingredients were white fish fillets, mushrooms, vegetables and plenty of herbs, with cheese melting on top. It is understood at first sight that the heating was proper, but unlike baking in a pot, it did not burn or shrink at all. It seemed that most of the moisture was preserved.

"Looks good, is it not?"

Asuna also nodded to Hana's voice.

"Well, let's enjoy it while it's hot. Kirito-kun, please help me to get five plates."
