"Tiese-san, Ronye-san. How is your injuries’ condition?"

When Vice-Prime Swordsman asked, they nodded at the same time.

"Yes, we’ve completely healed."

— when Ronye answered that,

"Kirito-senpai’d call that ‘hyakupa recovery’!"

— Tiese also showed a clenched fist.

*I do not know the meaning of the sacred word ‘hyakupa’<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, but it seems to be familiar to Asuna, as she smiled gently.*

"Yes, I'm glad. ...... This time we’ve got you two into some really painful experience.... "

Ronye and Tiese frantically shook heads towards Asuna, who moved down the long eyelashes as her smile disappeared:

"No, it’s all only because we went into such a dangerous place..."

"And thanks to Asuna-sama giving her good word, clerics director Ayuha treated us well. Look, it’s all right."

As she said so, Tiese lifted the jacket and underwear together, demonstrating her belly. Severe scratches left by deeply penetrating fusion-type minion's nails were completely healed, and no traces were left.

That's fine, but no matter how few people were in the Cathedral’s ninety-fifth floor, the "Lookout of the Morning Star", it was a little inappropriate for a girl to show her belly. Stretching a hand and pulling Tiese's clothes down, the other one said:

"Even so, Ayuha-sama's knowledge of components is tremendous...... We intended to study them quite seriously in the academy too, but she called out plants and minerals that have never even heard of before one after another, I was quite surprised."

"Even after Ayuha-san took the position of the Sacred Art division chief, she seems to go searching for a new kind of medicinal herbs on the seventh day. Her little sister Sones was complaining that those give medicine an odd taste."

— whispered Asuna and continued, smiling again:

"Anyway, Ayuha-san since her childhood wanted to become a doctor and it seems her plant research passion has rekindled after listening to the story that Kirito-kun managed to make Zefiria flower blooming in Northern Centoria."

"Ah...... It is not advisable to compete against the work of Kirito-senpai...."

when Ronye Unintentionally said so, Tiese cheerfully laughed. Tsukigake and Shimosaki who were eating dried fish on the floor also chirped "ku-ru-ru”; next to them, their new friend, miminaga-nure-nezumi, was crunching a deliciously looking nut.

Three days have passed since the incident in Emperor's domain, it was February 27th. On the 30th, the festival commemorating the anniversary of rebellion against the four emperors was planned to be held extensively in the whole city of Centoria, and the Cathedral was a little more crowded than usual.

But for the Union Council people, it was totally not a time to slack off.

Emperor Hozaica Eastabarieth of the Eastern Empire and Emperor Krueger Norlangarth of the Northern Empire, who should have been eliminated a year ago, were revived in minion bodies and became deeply involved in a series of incidents. Especially, emperor Krueger who was hiding in the territory directly beside the center capital Centoria and was about to proceed with mass production plan of fusion-type minions which are much stronger than the prototype; Fanatio and Dusolbert, as well as director of intelligence Xiao Shukas, received a deep shock when learned about it.

In response to the incident, the imperial territory of the four empires and private territories were searched all over again, but there were no discoveries of any hidden property of senior aristocrats leading to the conspiracy. What was most searched was the red gem that flew away from the emperor's villa to the western sky, but for the moment there were no results there, too. Since the object was jewelry not even of a human’s but only about of a bird’s egg size, it seems knights Fizel and Linel which were leading the search in the Western empire, were also struggling.

Another artifact remaining after emperor Krueger, the ring with the imperial house emblem, was jointly analyzed by Ayuha and Sones, the two greatest clerics in the Cathedral. There was no doubt that the secret of resurrection was hidden in that ring which the emperor called "katashiro", but *it is a hundred times harder to extrapolate the art synopsis given only an object used as an art medium......* that’s what Sones said.

In other words, almost all threads leading to the conspiracy mastermind were broken. Speaking of other things, both the pair of a large and a small knife used by great chamberlain Zeppos and the clay bags stacked in large quantities on the villa's premises, were unlikely to lead to new clues.

The Human World Union Council has decided to invite senior dark arts masters from Dark Territory to consult regarding clay and ring investigation, and the horse messenger was already sent to Obsidia castle. But it will take twelve days for a personal letter to reach general commander Isukan, and even if the invitation is fulfilled at all given the circumstances, it will take another two weeks for the reply to arrive from the other side.

On the other hand, Ronye and Tiese, after getting scolded by knights leader Fanatio for not returning with the report as soon as they heard a sound from the villa, as a result of their great contribution to the discovery and rescue of the abducted mountain goblins, were told they would be promoted from the apprentice knights to the lower rank Integrity Knights.

Formal appointment was scheduled to be in early March after the Liberation Memorial Festival, but they were already given the hint on knight numbers.

Following the knight Eldrie Synthesis Thirty-One who died a noble death at the time of Foreign World War, Tiese was given the number 32. And Ronye got 33.

According to the tradition of Integrity Knights, they both would have to throw away their family names, but "**synthesis**" is a sacred word meaning "a person who received the Synthesis ritual", so after discussion with Kirito and Asuna, the two who were not synthesized, were left to only add the number to their names. This way, the knights Tiese Shtolienen Thirty-Two and Ronye Arabel Thirty-Three were born.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>This is a combination of “hyaku” (one hundred) and “pa~”, first syllable of “pa~sento” (percent). So it’s a Japanese slang word consisting of a Japanese word, treated as a non-Japanese one, plus a syllable of another non-Japanese word, all in all, meaning “100%”. Good luck trying to adapt this… best thing I came up with was “damgud” but it’s so pitiful it only deserves a place in a footnote.
