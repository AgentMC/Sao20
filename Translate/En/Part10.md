"Tiese-san, Ronye-san. How is your injuries’ condition?"

When Vice-Prime Swordsman asked, they nodded at the same time.

"Yes, we’ve completely healed."

— when Ronye answered that,

"Kirito-senpai’d call that ‘hyakupa recovery’!"

— Tiese also showed a clenched fist.

*I do not know the meaning of the sacred word ‘hyakupa’<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, but it seems to be familiar to Asuna, as she smiled gently.*

"Yes, I'm glad. ...... This time we’ve got you two into some really painful experience.... "

Ronye and Tiese frantically shook heads towards Asuna, who moved down the long eyelashes as her smile disappeared:

"No, it’s all only because we went into such a dangerous place..."

"And thanks to Asuna-sama giving her good word, clerics director Ayuha treated us well. Look, it’s all right."

As she said so, Tiese lifted the jacket and underwear together, demonstrating her belly. Severe scratches left by deeply penetrating fusion-type minion's nails were completely healed, and no traces were left.

That's fine, but no matter how few people were in the Cathedral’s ninety-fifth floor, the "Lookout of the Morning Star", it was a little inappropriate for a girl to show her belly. Stretching a hand and pulling Tiese's clothes down, the other one said:

"Even so, Ayuha-sama's knowledge of components is tremendous...... We intended to study them quite seriously in the academy too, but she called out plants and minerals that have never even heard of before one after another, I was quite surprised."

"Even after Ayuha-san took the position of the Sacred Art division chief, she seems to go searching for a new kind of medicinal herbs on the seventh day. Her little sister Sones was complaining that those give medicine an odd taste."

— whispered Asuna and continued, smiling again:

"Anyway, Ayuha-san since her childhood wanted to become a doctor and it seems her plant research passion has rekindled after listening to the story that Kirito-kun managed to make Zefiria flower blooming in Northern Centoria."

"Ah...... It is not advisable to compete against the work of Kirito-senpai...."

when Ronye Unintentionally said so, Tiese cheerfully laughed. Tsukigake and Shimosaki who were eating dried fish on the floor also chirped "ku-ru-ru”; next to them, their new friend, miminaga-nure-nezumi, was crunching a deliciously looking nut.

Three days have passed since the incident in Emperor's domain, it was February 27th. On the 30th, the festival commemorating the anniversary of rebellion against the four emperors was planned to be held extensively in the whole city of Centoria, and the Cathedral was a little more crowded than usual.

But for the Union Council people, it was totally not a time to slack off.

Emperor Hozaica Eastabarieth of the Eastern Empire and Emperor Krueger Norlangarth of the Northern Empire, who should have been eliminated a year ago, were revived in minion bodies and became deeply involved in a series of incidents. Especially, emperor Krueger who was hiding in the territory directly beside the center capital Centoria and was about to proceed with mass production plan of fusion-type minions which are much stronger than the prototype; Fanatio and Dusolbert, as well as director of intelligence Xiao Shukas, received a deep shock when learned about it.

In response to the incident, the imperial territory of the four empires and private territories were searched all over again, but there were no discoveries of any hidden property of senior aristocrats leading to the conspiracy. What was most searched was the red gem that flew away from the emperor's villa to the western sky, but for the moment there were no results there, too. Since the object was jewelry not even of a human’s but only about of a bird’s egg size, it seems knights Fizel and Linel which were leading the search in the Western empire, were also struggling.

Another artifact remaining after emperor Krueger, the ring with the imperial house emblem, was jointly analyzed by Ayuha and Sones, the two greatest clerics in the Cathedral. There was no doubt that the secret of resurrection was hidden in that ring which the emperor called "katashiro", but *it is a hundred times harder to extrapolate the art synopsis given only an object used as an art medium......* that’s what Sones said.

In other words, almost all threads leading to the conspiracy mastermind were broken. Speaking of other things, both the pair of a large and a small knife used by great chamberlain Zeppos and the clay bags stacked in large quantities on the villa's premises, were unlikely to lead to new clues.

The Human World Union Council has decided to invite senior dark arts masters from Dark Territory to consult regarding clay and ring investigation, and the horse messenger was already sent to Obsidia castle. But it will take twelve days for a personal letter to reach general commander Isukan, and even if the invitation is fulfilled at all given the circumstances, it will take another two weeks for the reply to arrive from the other side.

On the other hand, Ronye and Tiese, after getting scolded by knights leader Fanatio for not returning with the report as soon as they heard a sound from the villa, as a result of their great contribution to the discovery and rescue of the abducted mountain goblins, were told they would be promoted from the apprentice knights to the lower rank Integrity Knights.

Formal appointment was scheduled to be in early March after the Liberation Memorial Festival, but they were already given the hint on knight numbers.

Following the knight Eldrie Synthesis Thirty-One who died a noble death at the time of Foreign World War, Tiese was given the number 32. And Ronye got 33.

According to the tradition of Integrity Knights, they both would have to throw away their family names, but "**synthesis**" is a sacred word meaning "a person who received the Synthesis ritual", so after discussion with Kirito and Asuna, the two who were not synthesized, were left to only add the number to their names. This way, the knights Tiese Shtolienen Thirty-Two and Ronye Arabel Thirty-Three were born.

After fighting with the emperor and Zeppos, the equipment control authority of the two rose to 40, which would be totally insufficient for a member of the Order, but Ronye did not feel that they are going to be regular knights anyway.

Perhaps, it was because of this she has not yet discussed the matter with Tiese since receiving an informal promotion two days ago.

Ronye several times invited her to talk, but each time Tiese said "Sorry, I’m still not......" and turned the eyes down. As for the reasons of why she did not want to talk about promotion, Ronye had a dim idea.

Perhaps, Tiese was thinking to settle two things before promoting to a regular knight.

One was the marriage to the knight Renri.

Another one was her feelings to deceased Yujio.

Originally, they came close to the sealed emperor's villa to investigate the rumors of ghosts lurking there. Come to think of it now, the inhabitants were taken for ghosts, or somebody noticed Zeppos digging up the forest soil.

But Tiese surely wanted the villa to be haunted ── the ghosts to be real. If the dead can really come to life again, she thought that she might meet Yujio again.

There were no ghosts in the emperor's villa.

But after that fight, Tiese's hesitancy must have deepened.

The emperor and Zeppos are the dead men who were revived using "katashiro" and minion manufacturing techniques. Which means that if one uses the same method, Yujio can also be resurrected.

Of course, Yujio himself wouldn’t want to come back to life by getting minion body. But even without her telling this, it was easy to understand Tiese’s painful feelings...... she would like to just exchange words with him, to meet him once again.

Her thoughts about Yujio did not disappear and postponed the reply to Renri, so an early promotion to a regular knight may had set a deadline for Tiese. Besides, Ronye knew that despite being cheerful as usual during the daytime, at midnights she cried alone in her room.

She wanted to give support. To ease the suffering even a little. But Ronye could not do anything.

Asuna planned a tea ceremony when she noticed the sad face that Tiese occasionally showed. The light of Solus gently poured down to the Lookout of Morning Star with its four sides open to the sky, blowing through with a breeze giving a pleasant sensing of long-awaited spring. Aromatic apple tea from chef Hana’s secret stock, as well as the apple pie Asuna baked, were very tasty; a smile would come naturally when one saw three girls who are eating a snack.

However, the grief living in the depths of autumn leaves-colored eyes of Tiese who seemed to laugh cheerfully did not go away.

*If it keeps like this, maybe Tiese refuses the promotion to a regular knight.  
On the contrary, she’d return the sword and the knights’ emblem and leave the Central Cathedral......*

Trapped by such a feeling, Ronye shortly sighed, when…

"Sorry, I’m late!"

— Kirito said this running up the stairs.

Suddenly Asuna stood up, hands on her hips.

"It's really late. We've already finished eating pie."

"Eh...... s-so my share...?"

"Not sure if anything’s left—"

"Ah, no way you—!"

After their usual exchange, Kirito put a long package he held in his left hand on the flowerbed nearby, and sat in a chair between Ronye and Asuna.

Of course, Asuna left a piece of pie for him, cut it and placed together with an apple tea in front of Kirito. Tiese asked Kirito who opened mouth wide and began working on it.

"So, Kirito-senpai, you said you’ll be late ‘cause of work, where did you go?"

"Om-nom-nom...... I’ve been called by Deus-san....... He said that he wants to strengthen the security system of the festival on the thirtieth."

Ronye decided to ignore the too familiar nickname he gave to instructor Dusolbert, and instead asked:

"Is it because the black emperors’ henchmen might set up on the festival... something?"

"B-black emperors?"

Since Kirito and Asuna exchanged looks, Ronye explained after looking at Tiese’s face:

"See, we do not seem to have an official name for those who have caused the series of incidents, so we call it like this..."

"Indeed, the black emperors’ henchmen...... Well, good, I'll call them this way as well....... Yes, it is exactly what Deus-san is worried about, but I think the possibility is low. The goal of the revived emperors was to start war again between Human World and Dark Territory, and the fusion-type minions prepared for that purpose were destroyed. Even if they are still aiming at the same, it’s going to take a while for them to prepare..."

"So...... In other words, if Tiese and Ronye did not uncover emperor Krueger’s retreat, that fusion-type minions would have been attacking the liberation festival."

Kirito deeply nodded to Asuna's words:

"That's right. Fanatio-san was getting angry with you earlier, but this time you two really helped us. After all, we have found more than two hundred bags of clay in the forest...... I’m horrified to think that all that could become new minions."

"In that case, what did they intend to put into the basic bodies...?"

When Tiese asked, Kirito groaned after drinking a gulp of apple tea.

"Hmm.... It is not realistic for them to kidnap all sub-humans who are currently staying in Human World, actually. The exchange project has been temporarily suspended, tourists are steadily returning home....... Oh yeah, Oroi and the other three mountain goblins will leave tomorrow morning. They wanted to thank Ronye and you."

"Yes, of course I will go see them off!"

Having instantly answered, Ronye looked at the eastern sky.

The Great Eastern Gate, which had been keeping Human World and Dark Territory apart for more than four hundred years, collapsed in order to contest the two worlds one year and three months ago. After the end of the war, the Gate was rebuilt, but the wooden door remained open all the way.

But after the old Yazen was killed, the door was closed again. In that sense, the black emperors’ conspiracy has already had certain effects. Besides, the incident had not been solved at all.

Recalling what she heard from knight Fizel in the large public bath, Ronye returned her gaze to the profile of Prime Swordsman:

"Oh, Kirito-senpai. It was only the emperor of the Western Empire, Ardales Wesdarath V, whose corpse wasn’t found... wasn’t he?"

"Yeah, I heard that. The Western Centoria Imperial Palace was burned to the ground by Fanatio-san’s memory liberation technique...... It took them three months to remove the rubble, so even if the corpse of emperor Ardales was buried there, by the time they reached insides of the castle, it should have dissolved to sacred power long time ago."

"Or he could have escaped and is hiding somewhere... no?"

When Asuna pointed that out, Kirito muttered with his arms folded:

"Well..... Emperor Krueger was able to hide in the villa I think because of the minion body did not have to eat anything. But if emperor Ardales is alive, he’d need food. And if he goes shopping, he would absolutely be looking suspicious and will be caught in Xiao's information network.…… However……"

"However, what?"

"According to Fizel and Linel's investigation, there were several former disseminated Western Empire Konoe knights order and whose current location cannot be confirmed. If they swore loyalty to the emperor, I don’t think it’d be possible to quickly move to Human World Defense Army..."

"If the former knights joined the emperor, it would not be difficult to get food, you may need to expand the scope of the search if it is the case."

"No matter how many hands there are, it is never enough."

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>This is a combination of “hyaku” (one hundred) and “pa~”, first syllable of “pa~sento” (percent). So it’s a Japanese slang word consisting of a Japanese word, treated as a non-Japanese one, plus a syllable of another non-Japanese word, all in all, meaning “100%”. Good luck trying to adapt this… best thing I came up with was “damgud” but it’s so pitiful it only deserves a place in a footnote.
