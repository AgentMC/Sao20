# Part 3

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

After the lunch on the ninety-fifth floor was over, Ronye returned to her room on the twenty-second floor and caught her best friend trying to enter her bedroom through the shared living room.

"So, Tiese, how to make that small book that you were using right now......."

"Notebook"

"Eh?"

"I will not call it a book anymore, instead I will call it notebook in a sacred language. This name is short and fits it so well."

While she said so, Tiese took out the notebook from her pocket, and Ronye upturned her eyes.

"...... What, Ronye, why such a face?"

"No, that's OK, but.... when you use so many sacred words, more than Dusolbert-sama does for instance, or other young people do...... that just feels weird."

"Then we can tell the teacher as well."

"It’s not what I....... ── Anyway, let me know how to make it."

This way Ronye felt that she falls more and more behind her best friend by the knowledge of the general purpose Sacred Language, so she insisted. Grinning Tiese held the notebook on her chest with both hands.

"Of course, I can, but you know, it was quite a challenge to bind all these thick white hemp paper sheets..."

"... I understood. A raspberry tart of «honey’s» candy store."

"Deal."

Having nodded with a serious face, Tiese took a folded piece of paper out of the other side pocket. It was not a white hemp paper but a regular one because of its thinness and hue, and it was covered with neat small letters.

"Here, kind Tiese has written how to make a note for poor Ronye. The most important thing is to use thin and durable yarn."

"....... th-thanks......."

Ronye received it with a bit of surprise. Perhaps, Tiese had made this memorandum — which should be “**memo**” in the Sacred Language — for Ronye long ago.

"Thank you, Tiese."

Ronye firmly grabbed her best friend's right hand with both hands, thanking her again, properly this time. In response, Tiese smiled embarrassingly and blinked both eyes.

After obtaining the manufacturing method, she would surely want to go to the paper factory in the corner of the twelfth floor of the Cathedral right away to pick some discarded white paper, but that unfortunately had to be postponed. Having changed in the bedroom into a knight outfit for going out and wearing a gray cloak, Ronye went down the big stairs with Tiese who had the same look.

The left through the front door of the first floor, and the afternoon sun gently caressed the skin. It was February so the wind was still cold but they almost could feel how it gets warmer little by little every day.

Away from the front square neatly decorated with pure white tiles, cutting through the front grass lawn in the southwest direction. Usually, they would go to Tsukigaki and Shimosaki in the dragon stables and stay with them till evening, but that day dragons had to wait a little more. Because they two of them had an important task to do.

Proceeding ahead, one could see as the spacious front yard is changed to orchards, with lined-up trees. Although most of the trees have dropped leaves in this season and the middle of winter is not rich in fruit, still there were many seasonal black apples and ice figs, spreading around faint sweet scent.

They just had a good lunch, but still unusual transparent light blue fig fruits sparkled a desire to eat at least one... and as they passed through the orchard withstanding the temptation, a huge wall became visible up ahead. This marble wall divided the grounds of the Axiom Church Central Cathedral from the outside world.

There were already figures of Kirito and Asuna near the corner where the south wall met the west wall.

The two of them wrapped in plain brown cloaks gently raised their hands when they noticed girls. Ronye and Tiese rushed through the last few tens of mel, stopped at the same time and lowered their heads.

"We’re sorry, we kept you waiting."

"It’s nothing, we also just came here."

Kirito grinned and added to Asuna’s words.

"We jumped off the Cathedral and saw Ronye and Tiese as we were going down."

Apparently, Kirito overtook them by the sky using his incarnational flight technique. One day Ronye already caught a glimpse of the surroundings from that height, even though she still couldn’t learn how to do an incarnational flight with aerial elements.

"So... why is this a meeting place?"

The destination of the four of them was the South Centoria city, and one had to go through the main gate in the middle of the southern wall to get there. But in this place where white marble walls joined at the right angle, there was no such thing as a passageway.

*Perhaps, there is a hidden door we do not know about*...... as she was guessing, Kirito shrugged and answered.

"The opening and closing of the main gate is conspicuous....... It is absolutely impossible to sneak in and out unnoticed because there are lots of tourists at this time in the square beyond the gate."

"Then, how about flying like before?"

There was some hope in the voice Tiese said that with. Certainly, four days ago, when they heard that a murder happened in South Centoria, Kirito jumped out of the terrace at the top of the Cathedral with Ronye on his left side as he was and went straight to the site by aerial element flight technique. The journey took just several tens of seconds, plus flying in the sky was a very exciting experience. It was natural for Tiese to expect something — but.

"Well, that'd be so conspicuous...."

While smiling wryly, Kirito added quickly:

"But today I think we will try a secret shortcut."

"Se...... secret shortcut?"

Tiese made round eyes suggesting that she was not disappointed. Prime Swordsman who changed the smile to a mischievous one lifted both hands without further explanation.

"Well, let's hold the hands, the four of us."

"............?"

Tilting her head a little, Ronye grasped Kirito's left hand and Tiese's took the right one. From the other side, Asuna took their hands and gave a slight nod, and four people formed a small circle.

Immediately afterwards, the green light blinked in the center of the circle continuously and the intense wind bounced the grass radially under their legs. Unexpectedly, Ronye's body suddenly raised with the poser of wind pressure coming directly from below.

"Wa! Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa..!"

Tiese shouted and began flipping both feet in the air. However, their bodies did not return to the ground and continued rising at about 1 mel per second.

Ronye, who was used to Kirito's ways a little bit better than her best friend, breathed deeply at the beginning of this new experience, but there was a chance to observe the situation. Beneath their bodies, the air was continuously released, creating a strong wind, but the crowns of the nearby trees were only moved with the natural breeze. If you look closely, there was a faint rainbow-colored light swirling just outside the four people. Someone — probably Kirito, created a cylindrical transparent wall around four people with the application of the Knight's secret "arm of mind" technique, which blocked the wind, so the freed aerial elements created a strong air current raising Ronye and others up vertically. In other words, in principle it worked in the same way as the elevator in Cathedral.

Tiese, who was scared, seemed to regain the control in less than ten seconds, and watched the area a while swaying her cheering face from one side to another.

"Ah, it’s amazing, I’m flying, Ronye!"

"Hey Tiese, do not let go of my hand!"

Ronye grabbed the hand of his best friend even firmer, and the four people continued to rise increasing speed little by little. The ground was already far down, but the white wall blocking the overview still didn’t finish. Looking up, the top of the wall drawing a straight line in the light blue winter sky was still terribly far away.

*If Kirito-senpai's ability to concentrate or the spatial divine powers turns out to be not enough, I wonder what will happen*... she forcibly interrupted the imagination and continued to glare at the top. The rise lasted for about 20 seconds, at the end they flew somewhat diagonally and finally crossed the edge of the wall.

Immediately afterwards, the wind pressure momentarily disappeared, and four people fell from about 2 mel. Girls could never imagine that practicing "Standing straight on the top of a pillar" would do any good, but this time there was not enough power to support her legs, and together with Tiese who stumbled upon landing, Ronye almost fell on her back.

But before she did, Kirito's right hand slightly supported her, and as soon as he saw the surroundings, Ronye let out a sound of astonishment.

"Wow............"

Speaking of the height, it was about the tenth floor of Cathedral — at most 50 mel. However, from the position they were the cityscape of Centoria, spreading to where the eye can reach, till it looked distant and hazy. There was more. From the junction of the southern wall and the western wall where the four of them were standing, the wall of the same height extended straight in the southwest direction.

"...... Here we are on the top of the ‘timeless wall’...."

Tiese whispered that, and Kirito silently nodded.

Timeless wall. It was a large white marble wall that divided all the territory of Centoria in the eastern, western, northern and southern parts — and further into the vast four imperial territories. It was built not by piling cut out the stone, but rather The Highest Priest Administrator made it to appear during just one night.

It is said that this wall, which lasts as much as 750 kilometers from the outer wall of Central Cathedral up to the "Mountain Range at the Edge" that encloses the Human World far away, is impossible to destroy, hence the name of "timeless". It was forbidden to climb it or damage it by the Taboo Index, and although there would be no one who tried to break it, Ronye understood that she just violated the second mentioned prohibition. Even if she was released from the Taboo Index binding when she became an Integrity Knight trainee, awareness that has been engraved for many years for years has not disappeared without a trace, so when Ronye looked at her feet she understood she instinctively began tiptoeing.

The marble that was assembled without any gaps in one millis, which should have been exposed to the weather for several hundred years, shined smoothly just as it was newly polished. Behind them, the corner of the wall nearby was sharp like a blade, preventing anyone from climbing.

At that time, a light noise was heard. Two light-blue birds flew down on the top of the wall from the sky. They jumped a little over the marble and watched Ronye with black eyes.

"...... Hu-hu, the Taboo Index truly has no effect on small birds."

With these words, Asuna gently touched their shoulders, and Ronye smiled at once looking at Tiese. She enjoyed the view once more and then understood it.

"Oh, is it that... Senpai is going to move on this wall until reaching the Inn in Southern Centoria’s 4th district?"

As she asked, Kirito turned around and finally laughed.

"Correct. As you walk here, they will not be able to see you from down there, and if you choose a good location, you will not be noticed by unexpected people when you get off."

"It’s not the first time, is it?"

With the slight delay after Asuna's pressing, he cleared his throat and said with an excusing expression.

"Ah, well, you see, the validation of the escape route is fundamental to the strategy...... Come on, let's hurry."

And Kirito began energetically walking ahead, followed by girls along with contritely looking Asuna.

There was an informal nickname given to each of the four of timeless walls dividing the Human World into four parts.

The northeast wall separating the Norlangarth North Empire and the Eastabarieth East Empire was the "Spring Wall". The southeast wall separating the East Empire and Southacroith South Empire was the "Summer Wall". The southwest wall separating the Southern Empire and the Wesdarath West Empire was the "Autumn Wall". And the northwest wall separating the Empire and the North Empire was the "Winter Wall".

It seemed that even the oldest knights Fanatio and Dusolbert did not know the reason why the four walls were called with names of seasons. Until the Human World Union Council was proclaimed, the timeless wall was an absolutely inviolable border, the Centoria citizens from the east, west, north and south did not have freedom of exchange in principle, and it was not possible to pass through the gate in each wall with the exception for merchants or wealthy tourists given bills of exchange.

Although the passage requirements of the gates have been eased considerably by that time, complete free passage had yet to be allowed. That was because the aftermath of the Rebellion of Four Empires was not quite completed. There was a possibility that the remnants of the Konoe Knight Order who raised the weapons at the Axiom Church might be hiding somewhere in the Human World and still obey the order of the emperor. They may also be involved in killing the old Yazen and kidnapping Lisetta.

While thinking this way, Ronye walked on the "Autumn Wall".

Since the wall had a width of 4 mel, there was no worry that one may stumble unless approaching the edge, and nobody could see the figures of the four from the ground. Perhaps it was the cold wind that blew Ronye's thoughts away, so she just walked ahead absent-mindedly observing the scenery.
