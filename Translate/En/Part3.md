# Part 3

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

After the lunch on the ninety-fifth floor was over, Ronye returned to her room on the twenty-second floor and caught her best friend trying to enter her bedroom through the shared living room.

"So, Tiese, how to make that small book that you were using right now......."

"Notebook"

"Eh?"

"I will not call it a book anymore, instead I will call it notebook in a sacred language. This name is short and fits it so well."

While she said so, Tiese took out the notebook from her pocket, and Ronye upturned her eyes.

"...... What, Ronye, why such a face?"

"No, that's OK, but.... when you use so many sacred words, more than Dusolbert-sama does for instance, or other young people do...... that just feels weird."

"Then we can tell the teacher as well."

"It’s not what I....... ── Anyway, let me know how to make it."

This way Ronye felt that she falls more and more behind her best friend by the knowledge of the general purpose Sacred Language, so she insisted. Grinning Tiese held the notebook on her chest with both hands.

"Of course, I can, but you know, it was quite a challenge to bind all these thick white hemp paper sheets..."

"... I understood. A raspberry tart of «honey’s» candy store."

"Deal."

Having nodded with a serious face, Tiese took a folded piece of paper out of the other side pocket. It was not a white hemp paper but a regular one because of its thinness and hue, and it was covered with neat small letters.

"Here, kind Tiese has written how to make a note for poor Ronye. The most important thing is to use thin and durable yarn."

"....... th-thanks......."

Ronye received it with a bit of surprise. Perhaps, Tiese had made this memorandum — which should be “**memo**” in the Sacred Language — for Ronye long ago.

"Thank you, Tiese."

Ronye firmly grabbed her best friend's right hand with both hands, thanking her again, properly this time. In response, Tiese smiled embarrassingly and blinked both eyes.

After obtaining the manufacturing method, she would surely want to go to the paper factory in the corner of the twelfth floor of the Cathedral right away to pick some discarded white paper, but that unfortunately had to be postponed. Having changed in the bedroom into a knight outfit for going out and wearing a gray cloak, Ronye went down the big stairs with Tiese who had the same look.

The left through the front door of the first floor, and the afternoon sun gently caressed the skin. It was February so the wind was still cold but they almost could feel how it gets warmer little by little every day.

Away from the front square neatly decorated with pure white tiles, cutting through the front grass lawn in the southwest direction. Usually, they would go to Tsukigaki and Shimosaki in the dragon stables and stay with them till evening, but that day dragons had to wait a little more. Because they two of them had an important task to do.

Proceeding ahead, one could see as the spacious front yard is changed to orchards, with lined-up trees. Although most of the trees have dropped leaves in this season and the middle of winter is not rich in fruit, still there were many seasonal black apples and ice figs, spreading around faint sweet scent.

They just had a good lunch, but still unusual transparent light blue fig fruits sparkled a desire to eat at least one... and as they passed through the orchard withstanding the temptation, a huge wall became visible up ahead. This marble wall divided the grounds of the Axiom Church Central Cathedral from the outside world.

There were already figures of Kirito and Asuna near the corner where the south wall met the west wall.

The two of them wrapped in plain brown cloaks gently raised their hands when they noticed girls. Ronye and Tiese rushed through the last few tens of mel, stopped at the same time and lowered their heads.

"We’re sorry, we kept you waiting."

"It’s nothing, we also just came here."

Kirito grinned and added to Asuna’s words.

"We jumped off the Cathedral and saw Ronye and Tiese as we were going down."

Apparently, Kirito overtook them by the sky using his incarnational flight technique. One day Ronye already caught a glimpse of the surroundings from that height, even though she still couldn’t learn how to do an incarnational flight with aerial elements.

"So... why is this a meeting place?"

The destination of the four of them was the South Centoria city, and one had to go through the main gate in the middle of the southern wall to get there. But in this place where white marble walls joined at the right angle, there was no such thing as a passageway.

*Perhaps, there is a hidden door we do not know about*...... as she was guessing, Kirito shrugged and answered.

"The opening and closing of the main gate is conspicuous....... It is absolutely impossible to sneak in and out unnoticed because there are lots of tourists at this time in the square beyond the gate."

"Then, how about flying like before?"

There was some hope in the voice Tiese said that with. Certainly, four days ago, when they heard that a murder happened in South Centoria, Kirito jumped out of the terrace at the top of the Cathedral with Ronye on his left side as he was and went straight to the site by aerial element flight technique. The journey took just several tens of seconds, plus flying in the sky was a very exciting experience. It was natural for Tiese to expect something — but.

"Well, that'd be so conspicuous...."

While smiling wryly, Kirito added quickly:

"But today I think we will try a secret shortcut."

"Se...... secret shortcut?"

Tiese made round eyes suggesting that she was not disappointed. Prime Swordsman who changed the smile to a mischievous one lifted both hands without further explanation.

"Well, let's hold the hands, the four of us."

"............?"

Tilting her head a little, Ronye grasped Kirito's left hand and Tiese's took the right one. From the other side, Asuna took their hands and gave a slight nod, and four people formed a small circle.

Immediately afterwards, the green light blinked in the center of the circle continuously and the intense wind bounced the grass radially under their legs. Unexpectedly, Ronye's body suddenly raised with the poser of wind pressure coming directly from below.

"Wa! Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa..!"

Tiese shouted and began flipping both feet in the air. However, their bodies did not return to the ground and continued rising at about 1 mel per second.

Ronye, who was used to Kirito's ways a little bit better than her best friend, breathed deeply at the beginning of this new experience, but there was a chance to observe the situation. Beneath their bodies, the air was continuously released, creating a strong wind, but the crowns of the nearby trees were only moved with the natural breeze. If you look closely, there was a faint rainbow-colored light swirling just outside the four people. Someone — probably Kirito, created a cylindrical transparent wall around four people with the application of the Knight's secret "arm of mind" technique, which blocked the wind, so the freed aerial elements created a strong air current raising Ronye and others up vertically. In other words, in principle it worked in the same way as the elevator in Cathedral.

Tiese, who was scared, seemed to regain the control in less than ten seconds, and watched the area a while swaying her cheering face from one side to another.

"Ah, it’s amazing, I’m flying, Ronye!"

"Hey Tiese, do not let go of my hand!"

Ronye grabbed the hand of his best friend even firmer, and the four people continued to rise increasing speed little by little. The ground was already far down, but the white wall blocking the overview still didn’t finish. Looking up, the top of the wall drawing a straight line in the light blue winter sky was still terribly far away.

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>Keep in mind, we’re not talking English word meaning here, but rather katakana ループ.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Welcome to the Japanese class. So, the native name for an oven would be 天火 which is pronounced “tenpi”. The “sunlight” would be 天日 which is also pronounced “tenpi”. But in Japanese it’s common to use “imported” word “oven”: オーブン, “o-bun”, which is used here and below. As for the next passage, it’s also 2 words of a similar kind.)
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>Sorry, couldn’t find an English canon: is it "siral", "chiral" or "shiral" Katakana lessons I took say "shiral", but hey maybe your canon differs?
4. <a name="Prim4"></a>Original reads: “who heard the story directly from Ronye”, but that’s not true as Tiese only has heard about the kidnapping an hour ago or so, and we’ve been following them almost without interruptions since then.
5. <a name="Prim5"></a>Not sure if it matters, Ronye says the name here in Sacred Language.-->
