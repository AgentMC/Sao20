The bell rang the majestic 3 o’clock melody.

Asuna said, while placing the cup of strong kohiru tea onto the table.

"Kirito-kun, you have to eat something. Even candy would do."

"Mm......, yeah......."

Kirito who was sitting with head resting on folded arms, stretched out his hand to the wooden plate of candies, and watched Asuna with a look as if he noticed something.

"W-what is it?"

"No...... I just thought that you often used to say such a thing in the past."

Asuna understood that the words he said with a bitter smile were not about the time they started to live in this world, but rather about the real world. She sat on the chair next to him and returned the smile.

"Because Kirito-kun, if you get hooked on something you can easily disregard meals, without even noticing it."

"Ah... Yui was also often angry"

Despite responding in a casual tone, Kirito quickly turned his line of sight away. But still he felt something changing in Asuna’s expression, stretched out a hand and gently stroke her hair. As she relaxed enjoying that feeling, the pain piercing the chest gradually softened.

The two people could not meet Yui, a top-down AI born in the former SAO and also their ‘daughter’ anymore. Even with Yui's processing speed it would be difficult to synchronize with Underworld, which had been accelerated to a rate of 5 million times, and there was no way to connect for her in the first place.

Lisbeth and Silica who had been logging in to save the Human World defense army from the crisis at the end of the Foreign World War said that it was Yui who led themselves as well as Shinon and Leafa to Underworld. She gathered everyone, explained politely and clearly about the current situation in the Underworld and the importance of Alice, and asked for cooperation.

Without that Yui’s actions, the Human World Defense Forces led by Asuna would be wiped out and Alice would have been captured by the Emperor Vector. Thinking that they could never meet their beloved daughter who worked so hard again ─ even more, that there was no way to even tell her a word of gratitude, was painful, but she surely would understand. Even though Kirito and Asuna had no other way to go and became separated by time and space barriers, they would continue to love Yui forever.

Yui seemed to describe the whole thing about Underworld and Alice as "a proof of the existence for all VRMMO worlds beginning with SAO and the many people who lived there". So Asuna had to do her best to protect this world. Now, when the path of reconciliation has been opened up to Human World and Dark Territory, it was absolutely necessary to prevent another war.

"...... because if we don’t work hard enough…"

Kirito muttered as if feeling Asuna's thoughts. He tapped her back with the hand that was stroking the hair, took some nuts and fruit from the wooden tray, opened the mouth wide and crunched them. Underworld was a virtual world, but unlike Incrad, when the hungry state lasts, Life level begins to decrease and the lack of nutrition eventually leads to a disease, so food was as important as in the real world.

The on-the-spot survey in the Southern Centoria administration held that morning revealed that there were no transfer orders for the three mountain goblins issued, and it became clear that the official who visited the inn did not actually exist. Although the seal of the administration was pressed on the order form, as was testified by the innkeeper lady who witnessed the transfer, but since the seal itself was of a simple design, it was easy to counterfeit it. If one could slip through the Taboo Index which forbids the faking of any signs and signatures, of course.

However, the man who killed the old Yazen with his own hand whom Asuna had seen in the "Past Reflection Art" — to be fair, she only saw an arm holding the dagger, but anyway ─ was clearly not bound by the Taboo Index. If the fake official who took away the mountain goblins was the same person, he could fake any number of stamps.

Investigation in the administration ended after the noon, and as a result Southern Centoria was under throughout search for the three abducted goblins. The city was vast, but it was still only a quarter of the circular central capital. In addition, the Southern Centoria guards tamed 20 desert wolves with sharp sense of smell, and it seems that whether the goblins are held in the building could be known by just sniffing the indoor scent coming from the door. By the evening all the buildings would be searched, so Kirito and Asuna were waiting for the report of discovery in their own Cathedral 's room now.

In fact, both of them wanted to participate in the search, but the knight leader Fanatio, who was concerned about the possibility that this abduction would be a trap to lure Human World Prime Swordsman in as well as the Yazen’s murder case, pleaded them to remain in the Cathedral. Then they wanted to at least gather in the large conference hall on the fiftieth floor, but then Asuna was strongly requested by the head of Sacred Arts division Ayuha so that she stays in her room until she completely recovers from mental exhaustion of the Past Reflection Art.

Even Ayuha Furia, one of the Underworld best arts masters, could not use Past Reflection, and the reason it worked for Asuna, although for a very short period of time, as Ayuha speculated, was related to the power of God Stacia.

Asuna repeatedly explained that she was the Real World person and not a reincarnation of genesis goddess Stacia, but not only staff and clerics of Cathedral, even Integrity Knights did not appear to be entirely convinced. In order to prevent the misunderstanding from spreading any further, she attempted not to use "unlimited terrain manipulation ability" as much as possible... but while trying to prevent the Kirito machine dragon from crash just one week ago, she have shifted the upper floor of Cathedral sideways.

Anyway, Ayuha thought that the spirit of Asuna was tolerant to some extent to excessive information throughput and hence she could endure the Past Reflection. In fact, the burden of the technique itself did not decrease, Asuna could use it because she strongly believed in herself, and because she was aware that the safety of the mountain Goblins is a major problem directly linked to the crisis of all Human World, or all Underworld.

As in the case of old man Yazen killed in Human World, the criminal who abducted the three people for sure was preparing a similar situation, that if three of them were found dead, the peace between two worlds finally getting its shape would receive a devastating blow.

If the mountain goblins are not found during the search of the whole city of South Centoria, there was only one way remaining. Again, at that inn, Asuna would have to use Past Reflection to examine the destination of the carriage. But this was problematic. Since it was impossible to move during the ceremony, it was necessary to repeatedly move to the point where the carriage in the crystal plate becomes invisible and see through the past again, but yesterday she used it once and that seemed to be enough for her to collapse. Asuna did not know how many times she could invoke the art, even taking breaks.

Kirito had a concerned look because he strongly hoped that the goblins will be secured before the Past Reflection is needed. However, those hopes were gradually disappearing. Even though two and a half hours have already passed since the search began, not the missing three people, even the horse carriage used for abduction, have not been found.

Asuna changed topic trying to soften stressed mood of Kirito who got silent again after having a cake.

"By the way, did the apprentice knights go out?"

"Eh......? Ah... yup."

After blinking, Kirito looked out the window.

"As I understand, Ronye's Tsukigake has recently disliked fish, so they went to a suburban lake to fix it."

"Heh...... So, dragons also have preferences."

When she quietly chuckled, Kirito also relaxed his lips.

"Apparently. Hainag, the stable keeper advised them, they should let them eat fish they caught themselves. "

"Ah, it's oddly delicious when you get it with your own hands. The old days I used to gather wild plants and mushrooms at grandpa’s place in Miyagi<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>...."

Memories of childhood reviving vividly made her to forget recent sorrow, and Asuna exhaled a sigh of relief.

*Come to think of it, the ingredients for cooking I have used so far have only arrived from the market of the central city, I never used the materials I picked up. But ingredients of Underworld also begin to lose Life immediately after being picked, and it seems that the value directly relates to taste, so next time let's try cooking in the place where the material is found...* thinking so, she casually asked:

"Where is the lake that they two went to?"

"Err, well, I guess it is not in the Northern Empire emperor's domain. Looks like the ice hasn’t melted yet...... although............"

As Kirito's word slowed down and broke off, Asuna tilted her head and looked at him.

Prime Swordsman intently gazed at a certain point in the air with an absent-minded face. Eventually, he slowly frowned and whispered:

"...... Not in the city of Centoria, outside the city...... For example, it’s possible they were taken to the former private territory...... is it not...?"

It was clear that the subject of the words were missing goblins. Asuna instantly shook her head.

"It is impossible. Since Yazen's incident occurred, people and horse-drawn carriages passing through Great Southern Centoria Gate are strictly checked up to the contents of the luggage. No matter how small the goblins were, I cannot imagine anyone missing the three people on board... besides, all of them must have been either restrained or unconscious."

"Yup, I think that it is impossible to go through the South Gate, but...... what about other gates?"

She stared at the face of Kirito who quickly responded with another question.

"... You mean that the carriage has crossed the Timeless Wall and moved to Eastern Centoria or Western Centoria.......?"

"Or it did so twice, to get to Northern Centoria."

"Uh-hu...."

Asuna caught up with the possibility she did not think about at all.

Even Asuna who have seen a number of virtual worlds, could not help feeling awe in front of monstrous everlasting and unbreakable structure extending in total for 3000 kilometers and dividing Centoria and the whole country of Human World into four parts.

They said, Highest Priest Administrator had made it appear overnight with Sacred Art, but even with the unlimited terrain manipulation ability granted to the Stacia account, it was absolutely impossible to imitate the same. The enormous amount of data flowing into the fluctlight could not be tolerated, it would result in unconsciousness after making a wall of about only ten kilometers.

Because of that perception, Asuna has never imagined someone could be able to trespass the Timeless Wall, of walking on top of it like Kirito did yesterday. Therefore, from the very beginning she eliminated the possibility that the carriage containing the mountain goblins passed the wall.

"... In order to pass through the four gates on the Timeless Wall, it is necessary to have a pass issued by Cathedral or a day permit issued by the administration of one of the four empires... but......."

Kirito continued after Asuna’s murmuring:

"....... Kidnappers were able to fake the transport orders of the South Centoria administration. Copper passes would be difficult to fake, but if it is a parchment permit....... ── In which case, the *modus operandi* finally becomes similar to that of Obsidia..."

The "black robe man" who kidnapped Ambassador Scheta’s and Commander Isukan’s daughter Lisetta, was hiding on the top floor of Obsidia Castle that everyone thought was impossible to make a way into. The reason that person could enter and exit the top floor seemed to have not been clarified yet. However, the behavioral pattern was indeed very similar to the abduction of mountain goblins this time.

For a moment Kirito tightened lips, then quickly stood up.

"Let's extend the search of the goblins to the Northern, Eastern, Western Centoria and the former private territories in the suburbs."

"Well..."

Asuna also stood up, turning her gaze to the south window.

Southern Centoria's red sandstone townscape was illuminated by afternoon sunlight. The sky in the west was already dyed gold.

"... Look, it’s evening already. Is it not difficult to search outdoors in the night? Not to mention that private territories are quite vast... "

"Ah... I see. The search over private territories can wait till tomorrow morning, but it is better for the city one to start at once. I’ll go to the fiftieth floor, Asuna you should stay..."

Asuna stopped his phrase with a fingertip pressed against Kirito’s lips, and said:

"For sure, I will also go, I'm fine, I've completely recovered from the exhaustion of the Past Reflection Art already."

"............... understood."

After nodding, Kirito took a piece of nougat from the wooden plate on the low table and thrusted it into Asuna’s mouth returning the favor:

"Then, Asuna, please eat properly."

*I know that* — she tried to say, but the only thing that came out of Asuna's mouth was "Omnomne".

***

When the two who rushed up the big staircase to the fiftieth floor entered the large conference hall, people surrounding the round table simultaneously turned their eyes at them.

It was Ayuha Furia wearing white robe who said first:

"Asuna-sama, please, you have not rested yet!"

"It’s all right, Ayuha-san. I had rest and I feel well."

Quickly answering this way, she somehow stopped the clerics leader who already began to stand up. Then, Fanatio, who was unusually lightly equipped<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> this time, said towards Kirito:

"Prime-dono, I'm sorry, but I have not received any good news yet. The search over the South Centoria came up from district ten to mansions in district three, and so fat it looks like this area will be a no-hit as well."

*The word "no-hit" which means that the effort is wasted should have come from baseball*<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>, Asuna thought, *but what it originated from in Underworld where the game does not exist — anyway it is not the case that I care about such a thing now.*

"Here’s the thing, Fanatio-san.",— Asuna said, sitting down on the chair at her place at the table,— "I think there is a possibility that a horse-drawn carriage containing mountain goblins went out of the South Centoria through the gate in Timeless Wall."

The moment she said so the wide conference hall became silent.

In addition to Ayuha and Fanatio, knight Renri, knight Nergius and knight Entokia were the ones who at that time were at the round table. The knight Dusolbert was at the temporary headquarters established in the South Centoria fifth district, and the intelligence department director Xiao Shukas seemed to be searching independently with her own men.

It was Entokia, which was surprisingly talkative as for the senior knight, who began first:

"Well, that is difficult, is not it? To pass the "Four Seasons’ Gates", you need a pass with the Axiom Church insignia, which is supposed to be made in Church by the Highest Priest-sama using Sacred Art."

"Eh… Is that so? Well, then, at present situation, it would be impossible to produce new ones?"

The knight nodded the head with bluish short hair to Kirito's question:

"I think so. Surely, there seems to be something I've heard that it is being created the way so that it cannot be imitated by any experienced craftsman..."

"That's right. When light was cast on the copper pass, the crest of the Axiom Church appeared to be golden, and I was unable to get His Excellency Bercouli to tell me how to make one."

*If Fanatio says so, it is no doubt that counterfeiting is impossible.* Kirito nodded, combining the fingers of both hands on the desk.

"It is quite possible that passes cannot be faked and let’s think again later on the matter of running out of their stock...... The problem is that there is a way to go through the gate without having a pass."

"One day permit......that’s the one."

— Ayuha pointed out, both Kirito and Asuna nodded at the same time. Nergius, who had kept silent till now, said after other knights also expressed agreement:

"......In other words, the insurgent forged not only the transfer order of the administration, but also the gate permit? How much Taboo Index violation will you put on them...?"

"No need to burn like that, Negi-boy. It's obvious that they are not worried about the Taboo Index at all, as the insurgents already killed people with their own hands."
