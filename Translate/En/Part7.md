The bell rang the majestic 3 o’clock melody.

Asuna said, while placing the cup of strong kohiru tea onto the table.

"Kirito-kun, you have to eat something. Even candy would do."

"Mm......, yeah......."

Kirito who was sitting with head resting on folded arms, stretched out his hand to the wooden plate of candies, and watched Asuna with a look as if he noticed something.

"W-what is it?"

"No...... I just thought that you often used to say such a thing in the past."

Asuna understood that the words he said with a bitter smile were not about the time they started to live in this world, but rather about the real world. She sat on the chair next to him and returned the smile.

"Because Kirito-kun, if you get hooked on something you can easily disregard meals, without even noticing it."

"Ah... Yui was also often angry"

Despite responding in a casual tone, Kirito quickly turned his line of sight away. But still he felt something changing in Asuna’s expression, stretched out a hand and gently stroke her hair. As she relaxed enjoying that feeling, the pain piercing the chest gradually softened.

The two people could not meet Yui, a top-down AI born in the former SAO and also their ‘daughter’ anymore. Even with Yui's processing speed it would be difficult to synchronize with Underworld, which had been accelerated to a rate of 5 million times, and there was no way to connect for her in the first place.

Lisbeth and Silica who had been logging in to save the Human World defense army from the crisis at the end of the Foreign World War said that it was Yui who led themselves as well as Shinon and Leafa to Underworld. She gathered everyone, explained politely and clearly about the current situation in the Underworld and the importance of Alice, and asked for cooperation.

Without that Yui’s actions, the Human World Defense Forces led by Asuna would be wiped out and Alice would have been captured by the Emperor Vector. Thinking that they could never meet their beloved daughter who worked so hard again ─ even more, that there was no way to even tell her a word of gratitude, was painful, but she surely would understand. Even though Kirito and Asuna had no other way to go and became separated by time and space barriers, they would continue to love Yui forever.

Yui seemed to describe the whole thing about Underworld and Alice as "a proof of the existence for all VRMMO worlds beginning with SAO and the many people who lived there". So Asuna had to do her best to protect this world. Now, when the path of reconciliation has been opened up to Human World and Dark Territory, it was absolutely necessary to prevent another war.

"...... because if we don’t work hard enough…"

Kirito muttered as if feeling Asuna's thoughts. He tapped her back with the hand that was stroking the hair, took some nuts and fruit from the wooden tray, opened the mouth wide and crunched them. Underworld was a virtual world, but unlike Incrad, when the hungry state lasts, Life level begins to decrease and the lack of nutrition eventually leads to a disease, so food was as important as in the real world.

The on-the-spot survey in the Southern Centoria administration held that morning revealed that there were no transfer orders for the three mountain goblins issued, and it became clear that the official who visited the inn did not actually exist. Although the seal of the administration was pressed on the order form, as was testified by the innkeeper lady who witnessed the transfer, but since the seal itself was of a simple design, it was easy to counterfeit it. If one could slip through the Taboo Index which forbids the faking of any signs and signatures, of course.

However, the man who killed the old Yazen with his own hand whom Asuna had seen in the "Past Reflection Art" — to be fair, she only saw an arm holding the dagger, but anyway ─ was clearly not bound by the Taboo Index. If the fake official who took away the mountain goblins was the same person, he could fake any number of stamps.

Investigation in the administration ended after the noon, and as a result Southern Centoria was under throughout search for the three abducted goblins. The city was vast, but it was still only a quarter of the circular central capital. In addition, the Southern Centoria guards tamed 20 desert wolves with sharp sense of smell, and it seems that whether the goblins are held in the building could be known by just sniffing the indoor scent coming from the door. By the evening all the buildings would be searched, so Kirito and Asuna were waiting for the report of discovery in their own Cathedral 's room now.

In fact, both of them wanted to participate in the search, but the knight leader Fanatio, who was concerned about the possibility that this abduction would be a trap to lure Human World Prime Swordsman in as well as the Yazen’s murder case, pleaded them to remain in the Cathedral. Then they wanted to at least gather in the large conference hall on the fiftieth floor, but then Asuna was strongly requested by the head of Sacred Arts division Ayuha so that she stays in her room until she completely recovers from mental exhaustion of the Past Reflection Art.

Even Ayuha Furia, one of the Underworld best arts masters, could not use Past Reflection, and the reason it worked for Asuna, although for a very short period of time, as Ayuha speculated, was related to the power of God Stacia.

Asuna repeatedly explained that she was the Real World person and not a reincarnation of genesis goddess Stacia, but not only staff and clerics of Cathedral, even Integrity Knights did not appear to be entirely convinced. In order to prevent the misunderstanding from spreading any further, she attempted not to use "unlimited terrain manipulation ability" as much as possible... but while trying to prevent the Kirito machine dragon from crash just one week ago, she have shifted the upper floor of Cathedral sideways.

Anyway, Ayuha thought that the spirit of Asuna was tolerant to some extent to excessive information throughput and hence she could endure the Past Reflection. In fact, the burden of the technique itself did not decrease, Asuna could use it because she strongly believed in herself, and because she was aware that the safety of the mountain Goblins is a major problem directly linked to the crisis of all Human World, or all Underworld.

As in the case of old man Yazen killed in Human World, the criminal who abducted the three people for sure was preparing a similar situation, that if three of them were found dead, the peace between two worlds finally getting its shape would receive a devastating blow.

If the mountain goblins are not found during the search of the whole city of South Centoria, there was only one way remaining. Again, at that inn, Asuna would have to use Past Reflection to examine the destination of the carriage. But this was problematic. Since it was impossible to move during the ceremony, it was necessary to repeatedly move to the point where the carriage in the crystal plate becomes invisible and see through the past again, but yesterday she used it once and that seemed to be enough for her to collapse. Asuna did not know how many times she could invoke the art, even taking breaks.

Kirito had a concerned look because he strongly hoped that the goblins will be secured before the Past Reflection is needed. However, those hopes were gradually disappearing. Even though two and a half hours have already passed since the search began, not the missing three people, even the horse carriage used for abduction, have not been found.

Asuna changed topic trying to soften stressed mood of Kirito who got silent again after having a cake.

"By the way, did the apprentice knights go out?"

"Eh......? Ah... yup."

After blinking, Kirito looked out the window.

"As I understand, Ronye's Tsukigake has recently disliked fish, so they went to a suburban lake to fix it."

"Heh...... So, dragons also have preferences."

When she quietly chuckled, Kirito also relaxed his lips.

"Apparently. Hainag, the stable keeper advised them, they should let them eat fish they caught themselves. "

"Ah, it's oddly delicious when you get it with your own hands. The old days I used to gather wild plants and mushrooms at grandpa’s place in Miyagi<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>...."

Memories of childhood reviving vividly made her to forget recent sorrow, and Asuna exhaled a sigh of relief.
