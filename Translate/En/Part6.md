# Part 6

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

The northern wind that was getting warmer day by day gently stroke the blue lake. The light of Solus reflecting on the surface of water burst into a bunch of small sparkles jumping across ripples.

The lake Norkia in the Northern Centoria suburb was located in an area full of low hills, and although the ice has just melted half a month ago, young early plants already sprouted on the shore and small yellow flowers colorized the view.

This area was the richest ground in the suburbs of the capital area, where everyone could enjoy beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons, but for many years ─ more than 100 years actually, it has not been possible for general people or lower aristocrats to come here. Because Lake Norkia has always been part of the "Emperor’s domain", the largest one among aristocrats’ private territories.

All the private areas were released after Rebellion of Four Empires, and now anyone could enjoy coming here freely, but due to the fact that spring was still somewhat away, there were no figures around the wide lake other than Ronye, and Tiese, and two young dragons.

Human World Calendar year 382, February 24th.

After completing the morning practice, Ronye and the other one took permission from instructor Dusolbert and knights leader Fanatio, and even from Prime Swordsman for Tsukigake and Shimosaki to leave Cathedral. Kirito was sorry that he could not go with them — but Ronye was fine with that, since the two of them did not just come to play. They were going to practice the advice they got from the stable keeper Hainag yesterday.

When Solus reached zenith, two young dragons that were running around the grassland and playing, came in front of Ronye and Tiese sitting on the rocks of the lakeshore and began to yap one after another. Probably running so much finally made them hungry.

The small horse-driven carriage they used for the movement so far ─ despite the coach was inexperienced, Tiese hired him to get them out ─ contained two lunches of dried meat and dried fruit just in case, but Ronye said without delaying any further:

"Tsukigake, Shimosaki, today you two are going to catch the lunch for yourselves."

"Kyu-ru......?"

It is unclear how much the dragons understand human words, but when they saw the pair tilting their heads having a confused look, Tiese smiled and rose from the rock.

"Here, come on!"

Tiese walked on to the waterside stepping on short grass, Tsukigake and Shimosaki followed her shaking their tails. Behind them, Ronye also got up and walked silencing the footsteps.

Tiese stopped at the shore where whitish rocks were exposed and carefully looked into the water, murmuring:

"Is there any..."

Ronye’s eyes caught countless shadows that swam quickly next to each other in transparent water. A number of small fish that overwintered under ice were forming schools. She crouched down and whispered to the dragons sticking their necks out between the two of them:

"Here, Tsukigake, it's fish. And it’s surely delicious."

The young dragon which recently left fish uneaten looked up at Ronye’s face and said "Kururu......." in a suspicious voice. Holding down the back of the dragon which began to back with the right hand she added some more words:

"Today, if you do not catch fish, there will be no lunch."

"Kuru~......"

That wasn’t true, and furthermore since she terribly wanted to laugh hearing the miserable voice of the dragon, but had to push, she frowned making a merciless face.

Ronye and Tsukigake kept staring at each other for some time until ──

"Kyu-ru-ru!!!"

Shimosaki who cried loudly swung small wings a couple of times to inspire himself, then quickly jumped over the water. He folded the wings in the air, straightened the long neck, and dived into the lake head in front.

Small fish swimming near the bottom of about seventy centimeters depth scattered in all directions. Following one of them, Shimosaki showed some brilliant swimming skills, wriggling the whole body.

A dragon is a creature specializing in flying in the sky as its name suggests<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, and the "Dragon nest" by the frontier of the West Empire is a steep alpine surrounded by a vast lake tens of times larger than Lake Norkia, so apparently wild dragons swim in the lake freely and catch fish. Tsukigake and Shimosaki, born in the Cathedral, have only bathed in shallow ponds in the front yard, but instinctively seem to know how to swim.

After a few tens of seconds, Shimosaki broke through the water surface, jumping out and landing to the original shore while vigorously flapping its tiny wings. Tiese and Ronye had no time to avoid it shaking the whole body and sprinkling a lot of water drops from wet feathers all around.

"Wow."

In spite of his turning the face away from the water drops, Ronye noticed something glittering in Shimosaki's mouth and tried to look closer. It was a trout of a silver body with small red spots visible over it. It appeared small when it was swimming underwater, but when looking closer it seemed to be a twenty cen full-length.

Tsukigake approached and moved his nose to the caught trout being kept in Shimosaki's mouth and carefully smelled it. But shortly afterwards Shimosaki turned his head upwards and swallowed the fish.

"Kyu-ru-ru-ru!!!"

To a satisfied cry of a young dragon, Tiese added in a somewhat astonished voice:

"The one who gets it, the one eats it."

But Shimosaki waved his tail again as if to say that he was still hungry and jumped into the water again. Tsukigake also looked into the surface of the lake but stopped its movement.

"Hey Tsukigake, do your best."

When Ronye encouraged it, after moving the body back and forth numerous times hesitating between hunger and diffidence, finally crying:

"Kuru~~!"

in a loud voice, Tsukigake also jumped into the water.

*I can chase the light-yellow figure with my eyes; although his movements feel slightly awkward compared to Shimosaki just now, it swims hard to chase fish. But the swarm of trout quickly moved from side to side and could not be quickly caught. To Tsukigake which is of a quieter personality than Shimosaki, I guess, the load of sudden fish hunt was too heavy......* At that time, Shimosaki who overcame them earlier, jumped in front of the school of trout. Tsukigake plunged into the space where the surprised school got disarranged.

As it jumped out of the water surface, a splendid trout, of about 25 cen, was held in the mouth of the young dragon returning to the shore.

"Ku-ru-ru-ru!!!"

Ronye also happily shouted to Tsukigake who boastingly showed the prey giving the loud cooing:

"You did it, congratulations Tsukigake!"

And of course, it is all great to make the young dragon happy, but Ronye unexpectedly sighed. Apparently, it was fun to catch fish, but it seems it didn’t help with the problem of fish disliking.

*If you do not eat it, you’ll have no lunch......* Tiese interrupted her just before she was going to begin scolding.

"Hey Ronye, that, he gives it to you, does he not?"

"Eh……?"

After blinking couple of times, she asked the young dragon:

"...... this fish, is this for me?"

Then Tsukigake cried as if enjoying she finally understood:

"Ku-ru-ru~!"

"All right...... Thank you, Tsukigake."

She stretched the right hand and scratched the head covered with water drops. Lifted the still pounding fish up with her left hand and smiled.

"I will have this for my lunch, but the next one you can eat yourself."

"Kuru!!!"

And of course, after a loud cooing, Tsukigake again jumped into the water.

From that point on, the progress of the dragons significantly advanced ahead. Instead of chasing independently, one chased a school of trout and the other went on ahead. At the moment when the flock was caught between the two of them and got disoriented, they simultaneously caught prey.

By the time the flock ran away to a deep place, Tsukigake and Shimosaki caught five trouts together, ate three of them and gave two of them to Ronye and her friend. The trout simply roasted by the bonfire burnt of some dry branches had pretty much artless flavor compared to handmade paper wrapping cooking of Vice-Prime Swordsman they enjoyed the other day, but they felt it was as tasty, either because the product itself was fresh or because Tsukigake and the other one got it.

***

Just as the stable keeper said, Tsukigake’s fish dislike has been corrected in a blink of an eye and it became same way not picky like Shimosaki, which ran around the grass once again playing after finishing the meal. The gardens of Cathedral were also large enough, but the dragons were also comfortable in the nature.

Ronye deeply inhaled fragrant air, thinking that they will go out more now.

On the little hill not far away, a chestnut horse, tied to a standing tree, was carelessly grassing. There was, a flock of about ten white water birds by the lakeshore, and butterflies fluttered from flower to flower. As usual, there were no human figures besides the two apprentice knights.

"It’s a shame, these territories were released, I wish people from the central capital come and play here..."

When Ronye murmured that, Tiese, who was drinking tea from a bottle next to her, slipped a chuckle:

"Ronye seems to be used too much to Cathedral life. Today is not the Seventh day<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, so you cannot go out of town that early today."

"Ah... th-that's right."

*Certainly, children are still studying at school, adults are supposed to be at work or doing housework. Although we’re just apprentices, we still can execute the privilege of knights who can act quite freely except for training in the morning, but I do not think that it is common around other people....* having pondered this way, Tiese added a little abruptly:

"Oh, but, as I heard, this Emperor's domain is empty even on the Seventh day, while other private areas seem to be visited quite a lot."

"Hmm............"

Ronye raised the gaze when she heard it.

The Norlangarth Northern Empire spreads out in a shape of a fan from the central capital Centoria. In other words, the nearer to the capital city, the narrower the land is; from the area about 10 kilolu away from the northern gate of Centoria they were in, the timeless wall separating the land between the West and the East was still clearly visible.

*Emperor's domain monopolized the land on the west side of the high road running straight north from Centoria, and the territories of nobility were lined up on the east side of the road. In other words, because the location of this territory is relatively close, there was no reason for onlookers to ignore it.*

Glancing at the profile of Tiese, she noticed that the area around her nostrils was twitching a little. It was a sign of her enduring of saying something. Having a slightly bad feeling, Ronye returned the question that her best friend was expecting:

"............ Why is the imperial territory so unpopular?"

Then Tiese coughed a little and pointed to the other side of Lake Norkia.

"There, can you see the house over there?"

"....... Yup."

Small nod.

On the other side of the lake there was a small forest, with a sharp pointed black roof protruding from the middle. A building of a castle size rather than a mansion was a villa which emperors of Norlangarth dynasty used for generations as a lodging when visiting the territory outside of the imperial capital. Before the Rebellion of Four Empires, they said, that nearly 20 guards and servants were stationed there, but at this time it was completely blocked, the entire site was surrounded by a chain bearing ‘Keep Out’ signs with no exception for anyone.

"The emperor's house? What's wrong with it?"

Tiese got a stranger look and said, looking to the one sitting next to her:

"....... Because of what’s there, in that place..."

"Of what’s there...being what?"

"It seems, they say...."

Whispering in a low voice, she brought her face closer to the right ear of Ronye ──

"It’s haunted!"

".................."

*I’ve got no clue what to respond to this.* She kept silent for a few seconds and asked briefly:

"By whom?"

That moment Tiese broke the serious face and shouted:

"Come ooooooon, you’re boring! That’s supposed to be scary!"

"Well, you were preparing for that story all the time from the morning."

"Naturally, I did not have a chance to scare Ronye before."

After Tiese complained using a sacred word that Kirito told her, Ronye asked again lightly poking her with the elbow:

"That's not Tiese's imagination, is it? Where did you hear such a story?"

"Last Seventh day...... the day you and Kirito-senpai went to Dark Territory, I shopped in the 6th district market and I asked an old man from the bakery. He said, recently the number of people going to see the former private aristocrats’ territories on the Seventh day increased so the bento and pastry baking business runs pretty well, but the former imperial territory seems not to be popular, because of the ghost appearing near the mansion......"

"Talking ghosts nowadays..."

Ronye shook head in surprise.

According to the old story told when she was a child, before the Axiom Church was formed, ghosts used to appear in the streets and villages all around and they were doing various things. But they were exterminated by church priests and Integrity Knights, and now it has become quite peaceful — all the stories have ended that way. Actually, Ronye has never seen any kind of scary ghosts mentioned in old stories.

"About that, the real battle, where casualties were among the emperors who did not surrender till the end, the generals originating from the royal family and the great aristocracy, or the heads of the emperors’ armies — was happening only in the four imperial capitals of Centoria, was it not? So why are there ghosts in the villa in the emperor’s territory?"

As soon as she heard these quickly voiced arguments, Tiese blinked a couple of times and smiled again:

"Hey, Ronye, aren’t you thinking of some mischief?"

"Mis...... mischief, not at all!"

"Fu~wa. So then...... is it not that we should quickly check it?"

"Eh?"

She winced back hearing this sudden suggestion.

"Ch-check...... that mansion?"

"Of course."

Nodded with a clear face, Tiese continued to stretch her back.

"Look, if such a suspicious rumor is spreading around, it might have an influence on the Union Council’s plan to reuse the former private territories, right? Even though we are still only knight apprentices, since we are the members of the Integrity Knight team, shouldn’t we go for it if we think that investigation is necessary?"

_── But I don’t think it is_<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>.

That was her first thought frankly speaking, but the advantage of her best friend’s opinion was surfacing clearly. *Instructor Dusolbert repeats that a knight who just waits for orders becomes useless. The whole afternoon was dedicated to correct Tsukigake's picky behavior ─ which is why we are here at the lake, but the daytime is yet to last for long.*

Ronye sighed and moved her gaze from her best friend's face to the southern sky.

A small hill blocked the view and the cityscape of Centoria could not be seen, but even though it was ten kilolu away, the hulk of Central Cathedral was towering in the blue sky. Over there, Kirito and Asuna should be waiting for investigation reports from the Southern Centoria administration now. In the case of its conclusion being a miss, which is likely to happen, a large-scale search will be conducted throughout the city of Centoria; should an emergency occur before Ronye and others return, senior knight Renri is supposed to come to the rescue riding his dragon Kazenui.

"...... I see."

With as much as possible calm face, Ronye looked at Tsukigake and Shimosaki running cheerfully around the nearby meadow.

"But what about these guys?"

"Don’t you want to take them? Something ghost-like shouldn’t like dragons which are sacred creatures. If it really comes out, though."

After a while, Ronye nodded to Tiese's words about which she wasn’t sure how serious the other one was. It is only Integrity Knights who can breach into the mansion sealed by the name of the Axiom Church, and dangerous creatures such as bears and wolves as well as ghosts cannot appear in such a place, so even if they take young dragons, there won’t be any danger.

"So, well......."

"Then, it's decided!"

Having exclaimed so, Tiese vigorously stand up from a rock she used as a chair. Ronye stood up as well and said touching the handle of the Sword of the Moonlight that was hanging at her left hip.

"For such a case, I wish Tiese would have already picked a new sword."

Then her best friend glanced down to her own Human World Defense Army standard sword and shrugged her shoulders.

"Well, that's right, but I also like this sword...... hands completely accustomed to it..."

She knew that feeling very well. Ronye was anxious to change a familiar sword, and it was hard to let it go, so she couldn’t force her.

When she silently nodded, Tiese smiled again and looked at the dragons.

"Shimosaki —, Tsukigake —, come over! We’re going for a walk!"

To which the dragons, apparently full of energy after eating plenty of fish, synchronously answered "Kururu ──!" fluttering small wings.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>It is the default for western world that dragons fly. That’s why no translators of SAO I ever read made an accent on it. However, in Japan, the dragon (竜, ryū) defaults to a prolonged Chinese dragon, which may not necessary fly at all. In these books all “dragons” of Integrity Knights, i.e. all dragons in Underworld — except, perhaps, for that legendary one depicted on the magic comb Asuna used — are “flying dragons” (飛竜, hiryū), which are more the traditional “euro-standard” dragons. Further I will continue to use just word “dragon” referring to the dragons we all know.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Tiese uses ansoku-nichi (安息日) which has a distinct meaning of Judaic Sabbath, but since it’s kanji and not katakana, she probably doesn’t refer to the name of day itself, nor to a term (as Underworld people know nothing of other religions), but rather to the fact that it’s the last day of week when people rest.
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>I guess あっやしいなぁー can also mean that she doesn’t like the whole idea in the first place, and in fact it’s probably both.
