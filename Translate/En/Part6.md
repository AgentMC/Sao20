# Part 6

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

The northern wind that was getting warmer day by day gently stroke the blue lake. The light of Solus reflecting on the surface of water burst into a bunch of small sparkles jumping across ripples.

The lake Norkia in the Northern Centoria suburb was located in an area full of low hills, and although the ice has just melted half a month ago, young early plants already sprouted on the shore and small yellow flowers colorized the view.

This area was the richest ground in the suburbs of the capital area, where everyone could enjoy beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons, but for many years ─ more than 100 years actually, it has not been possible for general people or lower aristocrats to come here. Because Lake Norkia has always been part of the "Emperor’s domain", the largest one among aristocrats’ private territories.

All the private areas were released after Rebellion of Four Empires, and now anyone could enjoy coming here freely, but due to the fact that spring was still somewhat away, there were no figures around the wide lake other than Ronye, and Tiese, and two young dragons.

Human World Calendar year 382, February 24th.

After completing the morning practice, Ronye and the other one took permission from instructor Dusolbert and knights leader Fanatio, and even from Prime Swordsman for Tsukigake and Shimosaki to leave Cathedral. Kirito was sorry that he could not go with them — but Ronye was fine with that, since the two of them did not just come to play. They were going to practice the advice they got from the stable keeper Hainag yesterday.

When Solus reached zenith, two young dragons that were running around the grassland and playing, came in front of Ronye and Tiese sitting on the rocks of the lakeshore and began to yap one after another. Probably running so much finally made them hungry.

The small horse-driven carriage they used for the movement so far ─ despite the coach was inexperienced, Tiese hired him to get them out ─ contained two lunches of dried meat and dried fruit just in case, but Ronye said without delaying any further:

"Tsukigake, Shimosaki, today you two are going to catch the lunch for yourselves."

"Kyu-ru......?"

It is unclear how much the dragons understand human words, but when they saw the pair tilting their heads having a confused look, Tiese smiled and rose from the rock.

"Here, come on!"

Tiese walked on to the waterside stepping on short grass, Tsukigake and Shimosaki followed her shaking their tails. Behind them, Ronye also got up and walked silencing the footsteps.

Tiese stopped at the shore where whitish rocks were exposed and carefully looked into the water, murmuring:

"Is there any..."

Ronye’s eyes caught countless shadows that swam quickly next to each other in transparent water. A number of small fish that overwintered under ice were forming schools. She crouched down and whispered to the dragons sticking their necks out between the two of them:

"Here, Tsukigake, it's fish. And it’s surely delicious."

The young dragon which recently left fish uneaten looked up at Ronye’s face and said "Kururu......." in a suspicious voice. Holding down the back of the dragon which began to back with the right hand she added some more words:

"Today, if you do not catch fish, there will be no lunch."

"Kuru~......"

That wasn’t true, and furthermore since she terribly wanted to laugh hearing the miserable voice of the dragon, but had to push, she frowned making a merciless face.

Ronye and Tsukigake kept staring at each other for some time until ──

"Kyu-ru-ru!!!"

Shimosaki who cried loudly swung small wings a couple of times to inspire himself, then quickly jumped over the water. He folded the wings in the air, straightened the long neck, and dived into the lake head in front.

Small fish swimming near the bottom of about seventy centimeters depth scattered in all directions. Following one of them, Shimosaki showed some brilliant swimming skills, wriggling the whole body.

A dragon is a creature specializing in flying in the sky as its name suggests<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, and the "Dragon nest" by the frontier of the West Empire is a steep alpine surrounded by a vast lake tens of times larger than Lake Norkia, so apparently wild dragons swim in the lake freely and catch fish. Tsukigake and Shimosaki, born in the Cathedral, have only bathed in shallow ponds in the front yard, but instinctively seem to know how to swim.

After a few tens of seconds, Shimosaki broke through the water surface, jumping out and landing to the original shore while vigorously flapping its tiny wings. Tiese and Ronye had no time to avoid it shaking the whole body and sprinkling a lot of water drops from wet feathers all around.

"Wow."

In spite of his turning the face away from the water drops, Ronye noticed something glittering in Shimosaki's mouth and tried to look closer. It was a trout of a silver body with small red spots visible over it. It appeared small when it was swimming underwater, but when looking closer it seemed to be a twenty cen full-length.

Tsukigake approached and moved his nose to the caught trout being kept in Shimosaki's mouth and carefully smelled it. But shortly afterwards Shimosaki turned his head upwards and swallowed the fish.

"Kyu-ru-ru-ru!!!"

To a satisfied cry of a young dragon, Tiese added in a somewhat astonished voice:

"The one who gets it, the one eats it."

But Shimosaki waved his tail again as if to say that he was still hungry and jumped into the water again. Tsukigake also looked into the surface of the lake but stopped its movement.

"Hey Tsukigake, do your best."

When Ronye encouraged it, after moving the body back and forth numerous times hesitating between hunger and diffidence, finally crying:

"Kuru~~!"

in a loud voice, Tsukigake also jumped into the water.

*I can chase the light-yellow figure with my eyes; although his movements feel slightly awkward compared to Shimosaki just now, it swims hard to chase fish. But the swarm of trout quickly moved from side to side and could not be quickly caught. To Tsukigake which is of a quieter personality than Shimosaki, I guess, the load of sudden fish hunt was too heavy......* At that time, Shimosaki who overcame them earlier, jumped in front of the school of trout. Tsukigake plunged into the space where the surprised school got disarranged.

As it jumped out of the water surface, a splendid trout, of about 25 cen, was held in the mouth of the young dragon returning to the shore.

"Ku-ru-ru-ru!!!"

Ronye also happily shouted to Tsukigake who boastingly showed the prey giving the loud cooing:

"You did it, congratulations Tsukigake!"

And of course, it is all great to make the young dragon happy, but Ronye unexpectedly sighed. Apparently, it was fun to catch fish, but it seems it didn’t help with the problem of fish disliking.

*If you do not eat it, you’ll have no lunch......* Tiese interrupted her just before she was going to begin scolding.

"Hey Ronye, that, he gives it to you, does he not?"

"Eh……?"

After blinking couple of times, she asked the young dragon:

"...... this fish, is this for me?"

Then Tsukigake cried as if enjoying she finally understood:

"Ku-ru-ru~!"

"All right...... Thank you, Tsukigake."

She stretched the right hand and scratched the head covered with water drops. Lifted the still pounding fish up with her left hand and smiled.

"I will have this for my lunch, but the next one you can eat yourself."

"Kuru!!!"

And of course, after a loud cooing, Tsukigake again jumped into the water.

From that point on, the progress of the dragons significantly advanced ahead. Instead of chasing independently, one chased a school of trout and the other went on ahead. At the moment when the flock was caught between the two of them and got disoriented, they simultaneously caught prey.

By the time the flock ran away to a deep place, Tsukigake and Shimosaki caught five trouts together, ate three of them and gave two of them to Ronye and her friend. The trout simply roasted by the bonfire burnt of some dry branches had pretty much artless flavor compared to handmade paper wrapping cooking of Vice-Prime Swordsman they enjoyed the other day, but they felt it was as tasty, either because the product itself was fresh or because Tsukigake and the other one got it.

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>It is the default for western world that dragons fly. That’s why no translators of SAO I ever read made an accent on it. However, in Japan, the dragon (竜, ryū) defaults to a prolonged Chinese dragon, which may not necessary fly at all. In these books all “dragons” of Integrity Knights, i.e. all dragons in Underworld — except, perhaps, for that legendary one depicted on the magic comb Asuna used — are “flying dragons” (飛竜, hiryū), which are more the traditional “euro-standard” dragons. Further I will continue to use just word “dragon” referring to the dragons we all know.
