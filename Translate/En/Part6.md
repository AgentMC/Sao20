# Part 6

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

The northern wind that was getting warmer day by day gently stroke the blue lake. The light of Solus reflecting on the surface of water burst into a bunch of small sparkles jumping across ripples.

The lake Norkia in the Northern Centoria suburb was located in an area full of low hills, and although the ice has just melted half a month ago, young early plants already sprouted on the shore and small yellow flowers colorized the view.

This area was the richest ground in the suburbs of the capital area, where everyone could enjoy beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons, but for many years ─ more than 100 years actually, it has not been possible for general people or lower aristocrats to come here. Because Lake Norkia has always been part of the "Emperor’s domain", the largest one among aristocrats’ private territories.

All the private areas were released after Rebellion of Four Empires, and now anyone could enjoy coming here freely, but due to the fact that spring was still somewhat away, there were no figures around the wide lake other than Ronye, and Tiese, and two young dragons.

Human World Calendar year 382, February 24th.

After completing the morning practice, Ronye and the other one took permission from instructor Dusolbert and knights leader Fanatio, and even from Prime Swordsman for Tsukigake and Shimosaki to leave Cathedral. Kirito was sorry that he could not go with them — but Ronye was fine with that, since the two of them did not just come to play. They were going to practice the advice they got from the stable keeper Hainag yesterday.

When Solus reached zenith, two young dragons that were running around the grassland and playing, came in front of Ronye and Tiese sitting on the rocks of the lakeshore and began to yap one after another. Probably running so much finally made them hungry.

The small horse-driven carriage they used for the movement so far ─ despite the coach was inexperienced, Tiese hired him to get them out ─ contained two lunches of dried meat and dried fruit just in case, but Ronye said without delaying any further:

"Tsukigake, Shimosaki, today you two are going to catch the lunch for yourselves."

"Kyu-ru......?"

It is unclear how much the dragons understand human words, but when they saw the pair tilting their heads having a confused look, Tiese smiled and rose from the rock.

"Here, come on!"

Tiese walked on to the waterside stepping on short grass, Tsukigake and Shimosaki followed her shaking their tails. Behind them, Ronye also got up and walked silencing the footsteps.

Tiese stopped at the shore where whitish rocks were exposed and carefully looked into the water, murmuring:

"Is there any..."

Ronye’s eyes caught countless shadows that swam quickly next to each other in transparent water. A number of small fish that overwintered under ice were forming schools. She crouched down and whispered to the dragons sticking their necks out between the two of them:

"Here, Tsukigake, it's fish. And it’s surely delicious."

The young dragon which recently left fish uneaten looked up at Ronye’s face and said "Kururu......." in a suspicious voice. Holding down the back of the dragon which began to back with the right hand she added some more words:

"Today, if you do not catch fish, there will be no lunch."

"Kuru~......"

That wasn’t true, and furthermore since she terribly wanted to laugh hearing the miserable voice of the dragon, but had to push, she frowned making a merciless face.

Ronye and Tsukigake kept staring at each other for some time until ──

"Kyu-ru-ru!!!"

Shimosaki who cried loudly swung small wings a couple of times to inspire himself, then quickly jumped over the water. He folded the wings in the air, straightened the long neck, and dived into the lake head in front.

Small fish swimming near the bottom of about seventy centimeters depth scattered in all directions. Following one of them, Shimosaki showed some brilliant swimming skills, wriggling the whole body.

A dragon is a creature specializing in flying in the sky as its name suggests<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>, and the "Dragon nest" by the frontier of the West Empire is a steep alpine surrounded by a vast lake tens of times larger than Lake Norkia, so apparently wild dragons swim in the lake freely and catch fish. Tsukigake and Shimosaki, born in the Cathedral, have only bathed in shallow ponds in the front yard, but instinctively seem to know how to swim.

After a few tens of seconds, Shimosaki broke through the water surface, jumping out and landing to the original shore while vigorously flapping its tiny wings. Tiese and Ronye had no time to avoid it shaking the whole body and sprinkling a lot of water drops from wet feathers all around.

"Wow."

In spite of his turning the face away from the water drops, Ronye noticed something glittering in Shimosaki's mouth and tried to look closer. It was a trout of a silver body with small red spots visible over it. It appeared small when it was swimming underwater, but when looking closer it seemed to be a twenty cen full-length.

Tsukigake approached and moved his nose to the caught trout being kept in Shimosaki's mouth and carefully smelled it. But shortly afterwards Shimosaki turned his head upwards and swallowed the fish.

"Kyu-ru-ru-ru!!!"

To a satisfied cry of a young dragon, Tiese added in a somewhat astonished voice:

"The one who gets it, the one eats it."

But Shimosaki waved his tail again as if to say that he was still hungry and jumped into the water again. Tsukigake also looked into the surface of the lake but stopped its movement.

"Hey Tsukigake, do your best."

When Ronye encouraged it, after moving the body back and forth numerous times hesitating between hunger and diffidence, finally crying:

"Kuru~~!"

in a loud voice, Tsukigake also jumped into the water.

*I can chase the light-yellow figure with my eyes; although his movements feel slightly awkward compared to Shimosaki just now, it swims hard to chase fish. But the swarm of trout quickly moved from side to side and could not be quickly caught. To Tsukigake which is of a quieter personality than Shimosaki, I guess, the load of sudden fish hunt was too heavy......* At that time, Shimosaki who overcame them earlier, jumped in front of the school of trout. Tsukigake plunged into the space where the surprised school got disarranged.

As it jumped out of the water surface, a splendid trout, of about 25 cen, was held in the mouth of the young dragon returning to the shore.

"Ku-ru-ru-ru!!!"

Ronye also happily shouted to Tsukigake who boastingly showed the prey giving the loud cooing:

"You did it, congratulations Tsukigake!"

And of course, it is all great to make the young dragon happy, but Ronye unexpectedly sighed. Apparently, it was fun to catch fish, but it seems it didn’t help with the problem of fish disliking.

*If you do not eat it, you’ll have no lunch......* Tiese interrupted her just before she was going to begin scolding.

"Hey Ronye, that, he gives it to you, does he not?"

"Eh……?"

After blinking couple of times, she asked the young dragon:

"...... this fish, is this for me?"

Then Tsukigake cried as if enjoying she finally understood:

"Ku-ru-ru~!"

"All right...... Thank you, Tsukigake."

She stretched the right hand and scratched the head covered with water drops. Lifted the still pounding fish up with her left hand and smiled.

"I will have this for my lunch, but the next one you can eat yourself."

"Kuru!!!"

And of course, after a loud cooing, Tsukigake again jumped into the water.

From that point on, the progress of the dragons significantly advanced ahead. Instead of chasing independently, one chased a school of trout and the other went on ahead. At the moment when the flock was caught between the two of them and got disoriented, they simultaneously caught prey.

By the time the flock ran away to a deep place, Tsukigake and Shimosaki caught five trouts together, ate three of them and gave two of them to Ronye and her friend. The trout simply roasted by the bonfire burnt of some dry branches had pretty much artless flavor compared to handmade paper wrapping cooking of Vice-Prime Swordsman they enjoyed the other day, but they felt it was as tasty, either because the product itself was fresh or because Tsukigake and the other one got it.

***

Just as the stable keeper said, Tsukigake’s fish dislike has been corrected in a blink of an eye and it became same way not picky like Shimosaki, which ran around the grass once again playing after finishing the meal. The gardens of Cathedral were also large enough, but the dragons were also comfortable in the nature.

Ronye deeply inhaled fragrant air, thinking that they will go out more now.

On the little hill not far away, a chestnut horse, tied to a standing tree, was carelessly grassing. There was, a flock of about ten white water birds by the lakeshore, and butterflies fluttered from flower to flower. As usual, there were no human figures besides the two apprentice knights.

"It’s a shame, these territories were released, I wish people from the central capital come and play here..."

When Ronye murmured that, Tiese, who was drinking tea from a bottle next to her, slipped a chuckle:

"Ronye seems to be used too much to Cathedral life. Today is not the Seventh day<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup>, so you cannot go out of town that early today."

"Ah... th-that's right."

*Certainly, children are still studying at school, adults are supposed to be at work or doing housework. Although we’re just apprentices, we still can execute the privilege of knights who can act quite freely except for training in the morning, but I do not think that it is common around other people....* having pondered this way, Tiese added a little abruptly:

"Oh, but, as I heard, this Emperor's domain is empty even on the Seventh day, while other private areas seem to be visited quite a lot."

"Hmm............"

Ronye raised the gaze when she heard it.

The Norlangarth Northern Empire spreads out in a shape of a fan from the central capital Centoria. In other words, the nearer to the capital city, the narrower the land is; from the area about 10 kilolu away from the northern gate of Centoria they were in, the timeless wall separating the land between the West and the East was still clearly visible.

*Emperor's domain monopolized the land on the west side of the high road running straight north from Centoria, and the territories of nobility were lined up on the east side of the road. In other words, because the location of this territory is relatively close, there was no reason for onlookers to ignore it.*

Glancing at the profile of Tiese, she noticed that the area around her nostrils was twitching a little. It was a sign of her enduring of saying something. Having a slightly bad feeling, Ronye returned the question that her best friend was expecting:

"............ Why is the imperial territory so unpopular?"

Then Tiese coughed a little and pointed to the other side of Lake Norkia.

"There, can you see the house over there?"

"....... Yup."

Small nod.

On the other side of the lake there was a small forest, with a sharp pointed black roof protruding from the middle. A building of a castle size rather than a mansion was a villa which emperors of Norlangarth dynasty used for generations as a lodging when visiting the territory outside of the imperial capital. Before the Rebellion of Four Empires, they said, that nearly 20 guards and servants were stationed there, but at this time it was completely blocked, the entire site was surrounded by a chain bearing ‘Keep Out’ signs with no exception for anyone.

"The emperor's house? What's wrong with it?"

Tiese got a stranger look and said, looking to the one sitting next to her:

"....... Because of what’s there, in that place..."

"Of what’s there...being what?"

"It seems, they say...."

Whispering in a low voice, she brought her face closer to the right ear of Ronye ──

"It’s haunted!"

".................."

*I’ve got no clue what to respond to this.* She kept silent for a few seconds and asked briefly:

"By whom?"

That moment Tiese broke the serious face and shouted:

"Come ooooooon, you’re boring! That’s supposed to be scary!"

"Well, you were preparing for that story all the time from the morning."

"Naturally, I did not have a chance to scare Ronye before."

After Tiese complained using a sacred word that Kirito told her, Ronye asked again lightly poking her with the elbow:

"That's not Tiese's imagination, is it? Where did you hear such a story?"

"Last Seventh day...... the day you and Kirito-senpai went to Dark Territory, I shopped in the 6th district market and I asked an old man from the bakery. He said, recently the number of people going to see the former private aristocrats’ territories on the Seventh day increased so the bento and pastry baking business runs pretty well, but the former imperial territory seems not to be popular, because of the ghost appearing near the mansion......"

"Talking ghosts nowadays..."

Ronye shook head in surprise.

According to the old story told when she was a child, before the Axiom Church was formed, ghosts used to appear in the streets and villages all around and they were doing various things. But they were exterminated by church priests and Integrity Knights, and now it has become quite peaceful — all the stories have ended that way. Actually, Ronye has never seen any kind of scary ghosts mentioned in old stories.

"About that, the real battle, where casualties were among the emperors who did not surrender till the end, the generals originating from the royal family and the great aristocracy, or the heads of the emperors’ armies — was happening only in the four imperial capitals of Centoria, was it not? So why are there ghosts in the villa in the emperor’s territory?"

As soon as she heard these quickly voiced arguments, Tiese blinked a couple of times and smiled again:

"Hey, Ronye, aren’t you thinking of some mischief?"

"Mis...... mischief, not at all!"

"Fu~wa. So then...... is it not that we should quickly check it?"

"Eh?"

She winced back hearing this sudden suggestion.

"Ch-check...... that mansion?"

"Of course."

Nodded with a clear face, Tiese continued to stretch her back.

"Look, if such a suspicious rumor is spreading around, it might have an influence on the Union Council’s plan to reuse the former private territories, right? Even though we are still only knight apprentices, since we are the members of the Integrity Knight team, shouldn’t we go for it if we think that investigation is necessary?"

_── But I don’t think it is_<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>.

That was her first thought frankly speaking, but the advantage of her best friend’s opinion was surfacing clearly. *Instructor Dusolbert repeats that a knight who just waits for orders becomes useless. The whole afternoon was dedicated to correct Tsukigake's picky behavior ─ which is why we are here at the lake, but the daytime is yet to last for long.*

Ronye sighed and moved her gaze from her best friend's face to the southern sky.

A small hill blocked the view and the cityscape of Centoria could not be seen, but even though it was ten kilolu away, the hulk of Central Cathedral was towering in the blue sky. Over there, Kirito and Asuna should be waiting for investigation reports from the Southern Centoria administration now. In the case of its conclusion being a miss, which is likely to happen, a large-scale search will be conducted throughout the city of Centoria; should an emergency occur before Ronye and others return, senior knight Renri is supposed to come to the rescue riding his dragon Kazenui.

"...... I see."

With as much as possible calm face, Ronye looked at Tsukigake and Shimosaki running cheerfully around the nearby meadow.

"But what about these guys?"

"Don’t you want to take them? Something ghost-like shouldn’t like dragons which are sacred creatures. If it really comes out, though."

After a while, Ronye nodded to Tiese's words about which she wasn’t sure how serious the other one was. It is only Integrity Knights who can breach into the mansion sealed by the name of the Axiom Church, and dangerous creatures such as bears and wolves as well as ghosts cannot appear in such a place, so even if they take young dragons, there won’t be any danger.

"So, well......."

"Then, it's decided!"

Having exclaimed so, Tiese vigorously stand up from a rock she used as a chair. Ronye stood up as well and said touching the handle of the Sword of the Moonlight that was hanging at her left hip.

"For such a case, I wish Tiese would have already picked a new sword."

Then her best friend glanced down to her own Human World Defense Army standard sword and shrugged her shoulders.

"Well, that's right, but I also like this sword...... hands completely accustomed to it..."

She knew that feeling very well. Ronye was anxious to change a familiar sword, and it was hard to let it go, so she couldn’t force her.

When she silently nodded, Tiese smiled again and looked at the dragons.

"Shimosaki —, Tsukigake —, come over! We’re going for a walk!"

To which the dragons, apparently full of energy after eating plenty of fish, synchronously answered "Kururu ──!" fluttering small wings.

***

In order to move from the east bank of Lake Norkia to the west bank where the sealed mansion stood, they had to make a considerable detour north or south.

The south side of the lake appeared to be wetlands, so the two of them headed north. It was easy to walk because parched grassland<sup><a href="#Prim4">4</a></sup> continued there. However, in order to go around the vast Norkia lake it was necessary to walk three kilometers and they were worried if it is too much for the physical strength of the young dragons, but surely, they were cubs of a creature being able to boast with the greatest value of life in Human World, so both cheerfully walked after two people.

It took them more than ten minutes to reach the northern end of the lake where there was a small river flowing into Lake Norkia and a solid stone bridge. This river was a branch of the Rul river, which originated in the northern extremum of the Norlangarth Northern Empire, the Mountain Range at the Edge, and its main stream flew along the high road to the central capital, filling the waterways stretched in the city with clean water.

When they were at the Sword Mastery Academy, Kirito and Yujio told that the source of the Rul river is located in close proximity to the village of Rulid where they were living. When Tiese pointed out that if they would have made a small boat and sailed down the river they could reach Centoria without having any hardships —Kirito and his friend were both silent for a while and then said simultaneously "I could not think of it".

In reality there were many shallows, torrents and waterfalls on the way and it would not be easy, but Kirito and Yujio still said that when they’d come back to Rulid someday, they will try it on the way back to the capital. Tiese and Ronye used to dream that should such a time come, they would join the two people, but that adventure was no longer possible.

They jumped down from a slightly shifted grassland to a fine cobblestone road and crossed the bridge.

From there to the mansion there was a single road. After they walked for some time, a vast field came up on the right. Shrubs lined up in order were grapes grown as the source of wine.

Ronye's father, a lower-class aristocrat, once said that if you turn all the vineyards in private territories of the Emperor and the Great Aristocrats into wheat fields, it would cover all the wheat consumption in the Northern Centoria within a year and they won’t have to bother about the bread from the northern region. The terrible size of the vineyard immediately convinced her that it was not an exaggeration at all.

Moreover, the wine the emperor drank was made only from the best grapes from these grape shrubs, so regardless such a vast number of shrubs, vine made on this vineyard did not reach the mouth of the general public because they brew only a small amount.

Hana said that when she was the exclusive cook of the Highest Priest Administrator, the Highest Priest did not care much about the luxury of drinking and eating, so the vine delivered from a liquor store in the central city — of course it must have been top quality as well ─ was fine for her; but, perhaps, emperor Norlangarth was secretly proud that he was drinking superior wine than the Highest Priest.

"...... What will happen to this vineyard...?"

Tiese walking next to her muttered this quietly, so Ronye slightly tilted her neck.

"It seems that it is not decided yet even in the territory reuse plan whether to leave vineyards or turn into wheat fields. Some of the former private territory people who have taken care of these plants until now want to go back here and continue making grapes......."

"But, if you have such an area, you cannot maintain it without considerable manpower....... I heard that similar problems are occurring in the former imperial territories of other empires."

"Yazen-san, who was in the territory of Emperor Southacroith, I wonder which way he wanted..."

Tiese replied after a short time after Ronye doubted.

"...... In the vision that Asuna-sama saw through the Past Reflection art, Yazen-san said that he was『no longer an active tenant of the emperor’s domain』, so he did not intend to go back."

"That... that's right. I wish he could enjoy a new career he had just found......."

They kept silent for a while, walking under soft sunshine.

The wind flowing though the unmanned vineyards shook feathers of the young dragons who were walking a little way ahead. Twisting grapevines stood leafless due to the cold, but yellow-green young leaves will soon bloom vividly throughout every branch. If they keep vineyards, by that time someone has to begin taking care for thousands of grapevines.

"...... You know, Tiese, if there are not enough people to work in the field......."

Ronye muttered this unconsciously but closed her mouth halfway. To Tiese who seemed to be curios, she said "No, nothing", which wasn’t truth.

*In fact, you should migrate Goblin tribes who are forced to live in remote areas of the Dark Territory and have them to work in the fields —* that’s what she wanted to continue with.

*But then, we will have the goblins replacing the serfs once forced to live a hard life in private territories. Of course, nobody is going to force them to work, but they will have to as the income will be the result of their labor; so, when it comes to "get inside and get to work", I think it means the goblins will be treated almost as slaves.  
── No, I can’t say that.*

The majority of people living in the Human World was forced to decide on the Sacred Task in the age of just ten years and start to work. It was rather an exception for children to enter high school like Ronye and Tiese did, and even for those two people, if they have not been Integrity Knight apprentices, they should have had no choice but to either join the Human World Defense Army or to marry someone their parents decide.

*I could not choose the future on my own, just like private territories serfs, so, in the essence, is there any difference between us?*

The doubt that had never occurred to her before swirled in her head, and Ronye almost froze in her steps. But suddenly, Tiese next to her exclaimed:

"Ah, there, the gate can be seen!"

She blinked and raised the face to see a beautiful black steel-made gate rising in the end of the road, where Tiese pointed to. On the other side of the gate there were magnificent old trees standing in lines, and the road continued into the darkness where the light of Solus did not reach.

After quickly walking the final hundred mels, the two stopped in front of the gate.

In the center of the gate consisting of thin steel bars, there was the huge emblem of the Norlangarth Northern Empire, depicting a lily and a hawk. Beneath, there was a sign attached bearing a white tree, being an emblem of the Axiom Church, and a sentence saying 【No trespassing without permission of the Human World Union Council】 written in black.

In addition, the gates were severely blocked with a sturdy chain, and the chain stretched to the left and right, it seems it surrounded the whole forest which was not small at all. Of course, it was possible to cut the chain or jump over anywhere around the gate, but there was no one in Human World able to try to break the blockade after looking at such a sign.

Following the two people, Tsukigake and Shimosaki looked up at the exquisite chain, snuffed it and snorted at the same time.

Meanwhile, their owners exchanged looks and Tiese said:

"...... We are the members of the Human World Union Council, right?"

"...... Every day we attend those meetings, is it not?"

Ronye replied this way but it should be mentioned that she used to onlook rather than attend the meeting. However, sometimes ─ sometimes she was asked for remarks, so she was not a complete outsider either.

Tiese nodded with gulp, then suddenly made a stern face and put the right fist on her chest and the left hand on the handle of the sword.

"Integrity Knight apprentice, Ronye Arabel! In the name of Human World Union Council, requesting the passage through this gate!"

The other one for a moment froze in a mute amazement, but somehow replied "Y-Yes" to a knight’s salute returning the same. Tiese took down her hands and said "Now, you too", eliminating the last resort to go back.

Similarly, the young dragons got permissions as well, and they all walked about ten mel to the right of the road and passed under the chain supported by thin iron poles.

As soon as they felt the air getting cold, they shrunk their necks. They would keep thinking that they just entered the shade, but it seemed that some unexplainable heaviness was contained in the air.

After they walked under the mossy trees and returned to the cobblestone road, Ronye confirmed the purpose of this unofficial mission with her partner.

"Hey Tiese, we came here to investigate ghost rumors... is this correct?"

"That's right."

"This means, we can go into the mansion?"

"That's right."

After nodding twice in a row, Tiese gave a mischievous grin:

"Weeeell, could it be that Ronye is afraid of ghosts?"

Of course, she couldn’t admit it there. The memories of the scary stories heard during childhood were likely to be revived, but she denied with a sturdy face:

"There’s no reason for that... besides, there are no ghosts in the present age."

Then Tiese’s grin faded away for a moment, but the expression immediately returned and she tapped Ronye's back.

"If so, I let you go into the mansion first! Yup, go, go!"

"I...... I understood..."

While thinking that she was tricked anyway, Ronye started walking with her back being pushed.

Supposedly, it had been more than half a year since this whole forest has been sealed, but the ground under the trees was kept unexpectedly clean. Or it may be that weeds are less likely to grow due to the deprivation of Solus’ and Terraria’s blessings because of the tall old trees. The air that was so refreshing when they were on the hill on the other side of Lake Norkia seemed to be a bit stagnant.

While walking, Ronye turned around to see Tsukigake and Shimosaki, who were well ahead of two of them until the gate, but now were following. The young dragons sniffed the smell of the road with a slightly disgusted faces and shook the raised tails left and right.

"What's wrong, Tsukigake?"

When she said it, the dragon following behind responded with a quiet "Kururu......". It looked like he is quite reluctant to proceed, but he wouldn’t stop.

A dragon is tied with a strong bond to a knight and sometimes tries to defend the owner by sacrificing it’s life. In fact, Ronye saw, just before the end of the Foreign World War, in order to protect the knight Renri from countless spears thrown by real world red knights, his beloved dragon Kazenui received those spears by itself.

As the war had come to an end, situations when Tsukigake or Shimosaki, already grown-ups, must do such a thing will hopefully never come. Still, Ronye was hit by a sense that something tightened in her chest for a moment.

*Today's day out is in the first place because of the dragons, so if they are uneasy, it would be better to stop studying the mansion......* she thought, but Tiese would not stop her feet. Forced to turn back, she lined up next to the partner.

*Come to think of it, the attitude of Tiese is a bit weird, I feel she is not the usual her. Even when suggesting to investigate the mansion, although it was a joke, she was strangely stubborn, and in the first place it was happening all of a sudden. It's as if she had planned this investigation mission since it was decided to go out to Lake Norkia.......*

"Hey……"

The moment she tried to talk to her best friend, the sound of the 2 o'clock bell far in the south in the central capital was heard. Tiese quickly turned the face to her and said:

"It will be dark if we don’t hurry. Let’s run!"

"U…uhu."

Inevitably nodding, Ronye chased after Tiese who began running. Young dragons also fluttered small wings and followed bouncing off the ground. Even a child of a flying dragon can get tired and it’s Life then starts to decrease the weather, so they’ll have to eat dried fruits brought from the carriage by the time the dawn comes.

The forest surrounding the mansion did not seem to be wide from the outside, but the winding road took them some time. About ten minutes passed since they heard the two o'clock bell, and finally Ronye was relieved to see the light ahead.

In the middle of the forest, a circular space of about 100 mel wide was cleared, and the problematic mansion was quietly standing in the middle.

It was built of dark gray stone, and the steep roof was black. It seemed to have 3 floors, but because it has few windows, it looked more like a fortress than a mansion. The front yard had already almost disappeared flower beds, but they only gave cold feelings because only the withered grass was growing there.

"... This is the villa of the emperor, for real...?"

When Ronye muttered, Tiese also tilted her head a little.

"Yeah, this...... this being the case, even residence of some great aristocrat would seem bigger....... ah, wait, there."

She lifted the right hand and pointed at the big front door.

"There is a lily and a hawk crest on the door, which should be only used by the emperor."

"Yup……"

Because there was an emblem of the Norlangarth family on the iron gate at the entrance to the forest and on the door of the manor, there was no doubt that this was the emperor's villa.

"... Let’s go..."

Tiese whispered and started walking. Next, head down, followed Shimosaki.

Ronye looked down at Tsukigake by her feet and asked: "Are you all right? Not tired?", to which the young dragon answered "Of course" or something similar since it spread its wings and gave a short chirp.

They walked the path stretching through the dead grass, between the flower beds, and stopped in front of the large door.

Ronye looked back, but the blue water surface of Lake Norkia obscured by trees could not be seen at all. When a thought that there was no meaning to build a lakeside house in such location came to her, there was a metal sound coming from behind. Tiese was grasping handles of both the left and the right doors with both hands trying to push them down.

"…… does not open?"

In response to Ronye's question, her friend gently rocked the red hair.

"Yeah, it sounds locked."

"Well, that would be expected if you think about it... doesn’t this mean that there is no one in the mansion?"

Ronye said so hoping to convince Tiese, but her friend wouldn’t let go her hand of the handle.

"But if it is a ghost, it can pass through even if it’s locked, can it not?"

"Eeee...?"

— frowning at unexpected objections. Certainly, ghosts of ancient tales usually had no real substance and it looks like there were some which could slip through walls and doors.

"...... even so, we just can’t leave it like this..."

Having muttered this, Tiese closed both eyes still gripping the handle, and gave a strange groan.

"... N... n-mu-mu-mu-mu...."

"W-what are you doing?"

"Mu-mu-mu-mu-mu......!"

"S-stop, Tiese, come on!"

She finally noticed that something was wrong with the way her friend gripped the handle.

*Tiese must be trying to imitate the "Pick of Mind" that Kirito showed us in the inn at Southern Centoria yesterday.*

"Hey...... we still cannot use even the "Arm of Mind", and of course we can’t do something like picking a lock!"

Ronye pointed out completely amazed, but Tiese’s profile remained seriously resolute ─ perhaps even desperate rather than that; having noticed that she breathed in some air.

After hesitating a couple of times, she quietly asked:

"....... Tiese, why, so hard...... Is it so important to investigate the ghosts rumors...?"

Then Tiese slowly breathed out and let go of the handles.

Although, she remained leaning as she was before, and it wasn’t immediately that her faint voice returned a question:

"...... Ronye, those ghosts, do you really think that is the case?"

"Eh…………"

After hearing the question, Ronye quickly closed her mouth, feeling like a silly child trying to laugh at something important. The profile of Tiese was as serious as ever, and there was nothing to be joking about. The reason was completely unknown, but Ronye knew, if her best friend is asking seriously, she had to think and answer properly.

Ghost ── Ronye haven’t seen with her own eyes the soul of a human who died in hatred or sorrow wandering without reaching the divine world. Of course, same goes for her mother and grandmothers who let her hear old stories about ghosts.

*Then, even if one says that genuine ghosts appeared hundreds of years ago as it is said in the old tales, it also seems wrong. Because the divine world that the dead human soul is guided to probably does not exist itself. Outside of the Underworld is the Real World which Kirito and Asuna came from, there are no gods there, just humans fighting each other for thousands of years.*

*If the divine world does not exist, this world must be full of ghosts created of the souls of the dead people. But that is not the case, a human soul disappears at the moment of death no matter if it is holding a hatred or sorrow and doesn’t become a ghost.*

Ronye inhaled to express his thoughts.

But just before the voice came out, one scene revived vividly in her mind, and Ronye opened her eyes.

_I have never seen a scary ghost.    
However, I have seen a glimpse of a soul of a one who died.  
That was when Kirito was awakened from a long sleep and fiercely fought the man in black cloak<sup><a href="#Prim5">5</a></sup> who was directing the real world's red knights just before the end of the Foreign World War._

At the moment when a huge hatchet held by a black mantle man stroke sparkles from Kirito's sword and even cut his shoulder a little, Tiese gripped both hands and prayed. *Please, Yujio-senpai. Help Kirito-senpai......* and then.

And as if responding to that voice, a transparent golden arm emerged, supporting the Sword of the Night Sky Kirito was holding. With the help of that hand, Kirito pushed back the crowd and triumphantly fought against the black mantle man. That was without a doubt the hand of the person who should not be in the world anymore — hand of Kirito's best friend, Tiese’s mentor, an elite swordsman-in-training Yujio.

"....... Tiese............ you............"

Ronye whispered her best friend's name completely forgetting about the ghost thing they were talking just now. She felt like she could finally understand why Tiese stuck to the gossip rumors about the abandoned mansion.

It was the moment when she stretched the right hand to touch the back of Tiese who was looking down.

Faint ── but definite sounds reached their ears; Ronye winced and froze. At the same time Tiese gently lifted her face.

![Image](/Translate/Img/p167.jpg)

It was not a natural sound that they heard. An unpleasant grinding sound like metal and metal rubbing together. Besides, it definitely came from behind the closed door.

Ronye signaled to turned Tiese by putting her index finger to her lips and softly pressed the left ear against the big door.

A few seconds passed, but nothing could be heard. However, that sound was not an illusion.

When she took her face off the door, Tiese, whose face appeared to completely lose the blood, whispered in a very quiet voice.

"...... if we don’t peek inside…"

"............"

Ronye got lost whether she should nod.

Even if the gossip is true, I cannot believe that ghost is a Tiese's love...... Yujio. Yujio lost his life at the top floor of the Central Cathedral and cannot appear at the villa in Emperor's domain.

And if it was not a ghost but a living human who made a sound, it is highly unlikely that they are innocent public. 

Because it is only those who oppose the authority of the church and the Taboo Index who is able to go into the mansion, which was closed in the name of the Human World Union Council...... in other words, Axiom Church.

Ronye thought that she should return to Cathedral now and report it to Kirito or Fanatio, but Tiese moved before she was able to suggest it. She began running towards the South along the walls of the house, apparently planning to go around the back of the building. Shimosaki followed her, jumping behind.

"Kururu!!!"

Encouraged by Tsukigake to chirping by her feet, Ronye also kicked off the ground.

*Even if she goes to the back door, it should be locked of course. I do not know what Tiese is going to do, but I have to stop her before she is going to do something unreasonable.* Even so, she couldn’t catch up with her partner running ten mels ahead.

After she turned around the corner of the mansion twice and entered the backyard, it got dramatically darker. There was also a flower bed in the backyard, but since the sunlight hardly reached it, there were mostly bluish mosses and gray ferns. In the aisle there were broken wheels and decayed trees and there is no way anymore to say it’s the emperor's villa.

The back door that Tiese would be aiming was secretly set up on the north side of the building. In other words, it would have been closer to reach it from the north side instead of the south, but Tiese jumped to a small door increasing the run speed even more as if she did not care at all.

She grasped the blue rusted round handle and try to rotate, but just as Ronye expected, only the rusty click sounded. Nevertheless, Tiese continued to pull the handle with force. Even though she was an apprentice, her authority for armor equipment was similar to one of a knight, around 40, so even with pure brute force she could destroy the door. This mansion was handed over from the emperor and was by that moment the property of the Human World Union Council, so even in an emergency situation it was not permitted for a knight to damage it without a Council permission.

Ronye, who finally managed to catch up with her friend, quickly pressed Tiese's right hand.

"No Tiese, doors like that will break if you use the power."

"But...... inside, the sound......"

The profile of Tiese who answered in a trembling voice looked strangely pale even in the shade. Having wrapped her cold right hand with both hands, Ronye continued firmly:

"I heard that sound too. It was not a mishearing. But that's why I have to be insist."

Ronye gradually removed Tiese’s right hand from the handle and moved<sup><a href="#Prim6">6</a></sup> it by about 1 mel away, then looked around the backyard again.

"...... It might be a ghost in the building, but there is also a possibility that it is not the case. If a living person is entering and leaving the mansion, they should have left a trace somewhere."

Tiese who heard these words nodded a little after blinking several times. The color gradually returned to her relieved face.

"Yup... that's right. Let's examine this neighborhood."

Ronye nodded to her friend who finally regained control, and her gaze continued to wander around.

The dark backyard was narrower than the front one, but still there was a width of 100 mels and a depth of 30 mels. Mossy flower beds were on the right and left sides, and in the center was a pond of unhealthy dark-green color. The passages were heaped with broken trash, with weeds growing high everywhere, shortly speaking, there simply was no good place to start inspection with.

*No, don’t try to find something blindly. First of all, use your head and narrow down the area you should check.*

"...... If there are people coming in and out through this back door..."

Having muttered this, Ronye gazed at the ground in front of the door.

*Would the soil be popping out, we could have looked for footprints; but unfortunately, the passage is tiled with gray cobblestone, just like the front yard is. However, unlike the front yard, the thin layer of moss covers stone here and there. It is not thick enough to have footprints left, but perhaps that ──*

"Tiese, can you look after the dragons for a second?"

"Y-yup."

Ronye waited till Tiese who took a few steps back squatted and put hands on Tsukigake’s and Shimosaki’s backs, then protruded her right hand forward.

"**System Call. Generate Umbra Element.**"

Generated by the incantation was a black extremely small sphere surrounded by blue-violet phosphorescence as if it was a hole in the space. It was the "darkness element", the hardest one to handle among the eight kinds of elements.

As opposed to luminous element, it had a negative nature, so after discharging it would disappear while sucking the surroundings in itself. It’s fine if it happens to water or air, but is really serious if it touches objects or people. However, by utilizing some of it’s properties, it can also be used in a quite different way from other elements.

"**Form element, mist shape.**"

As Ronye continued the incantation, the dark matter disintegrated without a sound, turning into a purple fog. When used for attack, it was usually mixed with the vortex made of aerial element and directed to hit the enemy, but now it is not necessary.

Using both hands, Ronye spread the fog into a flat surface, then whispered:

"**Discharge.**"

The purple mist quickly began to spread ahead.

This fog had the ability of absorbing the sacred power, as well as concealing the reaction. This way, if it’s mixed with aerial element-made tornado, the blades of the wind cut through the enemy's skin, and the fog is left in the wound, silently but steadily sucking out the blood which is the source of sacred power.

And sacred power is not just for humans and animals, but also plants — even for the moss grown over the cobblestone. Of course, it’s amount would be quite modest, but if such moss is hurt by being stepped on multiple times, a small amount of sacred power will be released to surrounding space.

The stripes of released violet mist were drawn to the ground, forming fine twisting branches similar to a plant and shining mysteriously. The shape and the arrangement of it was undoubtedly human footprints. Moreover, from the way it was shining, it was only recently that moss was stepped on.

Footprints extended north from the back door of the mansion and disappeared in the forest surrounding the backyard.

"Tiese, over there!"

Ronye quietly exclaimed and rushed after the light drawing the fading footprints.

They turned left at the northern end of the backyard, entering a cave-like path opening like a mouth in the wall of forest. Because the bush and undergrowth have been cut down, and the obstructing branches were also dropped, it was clearly done by the human hand. In the bottom of the dark wood path, footprints were glowing bright purple.

She stopped at the entrance of the path and whispered to Tiese who has just caught up:

"Be careful, if we come across the owner of footprints, we might be discovered."

"Understood."

Her gaze moved to the feet her nodding friend, where two serious looking young dragons also winced ears. Since it is possible that there may be a battle with the footprints owner should they proceed this way, it would be best to have dragons stayed, but she couldn’t say that the backyard of the mansion was safe.

Judging that there was no choice but to take them along, Ronye bent backward.

"You guys keep quiet."

After she lightly stroke the head of Tsukigake who responded with a quiet **ku-ru-ru**, the dragon slowly stretched the back.

Another glance at the footpath revealed that the footprints of light had already disappeared, but there was no danger of getting lost due to the size of the forest. They with Tiese nodded to each other and stepped inside together.

Just after a few mels on the dark path the air became freezingly cold. That day was warm manifesting the soon coming of spring, but the air the darkness exhaled seemed to be colored midwinter-white.

*I have bad feeling*, thought Ronye. The throne in the Norlangarth castle to which they rushed together with Tiese at the time of the Rebellion of Four Empires was filled with same heavy air. It was not just cold, it rather felt that the cold air soaking in the walls and floor for a long time somehow deprived the warmth.

The two-thirty bell haven’t rung yet, but the darkness was steadily increasing as they proceeded. Both sides of the path were blocked by a hedge with sharp thorns, and more and more branches of old trees overlapped above their heads.

*What if it gets darker even more, and I can’t use the light element’s light.....*. she thought, and then:

"Ah...... Ronye, there!"

Tiese sharply whispered, Ronye also stared ahead.

In the depths of the darkness, there was a number of vertically standing metal rods. The first guess would be that they reached the iron fence surrounding the forest. However, that was the iron gate rather than a fence. There was a small building, about of a shrine’s size, in the end of the path, and the gate was the front door bars.

They halted, making sure that there are no signs of people around, then carefully approached.

"... this building, it is quite old...."

Like Tiese murmured, the stone walls looked dusty are blackened as if exposed to the wind and rain, and moss was covering the areas touching the ground, appeared that in ten-twenty years’ time this won’t stand anymore without proper support. A high double iron gate was also thin and covered with rust, it didn’t seem that a high priority material would be decaying so much.

The left and right doors fitted together without any gaps, and a sturdy lock was installed about one mel from the ground. Pulling the iron grid with both hands gently, as expected, did not break them open. On the other side of the door there was a staircase descending below the ground, ending with the complete darkness.

"It's locked here too."

Tiese replied to Ronye’s words with a regretful face.

"And yet there’s something inside, for sure......."

That tone, radiating with the same emotions she felt recently, made Ronye relieved a little bit. Of course, it did not mean that the fear of ghosts has gone, but someone who is coming in and out through the back door of the mansion was obviously not ghost, but a living being. Perhaps, the same people who made sounds in the mansion.

*As an apprentice knight I’d very much like to identify the person who is breaking the Human World Union Council's no-entry ban and catch this villain — but that does not mean I can destroy the lock. There is no crime committed in front of my eyes.*

*It’s a pity*, Ronye thought, *but there is no choice but to go back to the Cathedral and report the situation and get back with someone of the senior knights*. But Tiese exclaimed the same she said just now:

"Ah....... over there!"

She pointed to the wall on the right side of the descending staircase with her right hand protruding into the gap in the iron grating. Ronye also brought her face close to the gate, staring into the deeps of the darkness.

There was something blinking around the seventh step down the stairs. A broken nail stuck in a wall, something of a dull silver color hanging on a string over it, something elongated......

"…………key!"

They exclaimed together and exchanged looks.

It was probably a duplicate key prepared for the time when someone gets locked inside by chance. In other words, this exotic grid door was to prevent intrusion from the outside.

At the same time, they both tried to reach out through the gap in the grid, but since the width of the gap was only ten cens, only a shoulder would fit and the key would be out of reach.

"... an "arm of mind" could be used here......."

Overall, one could agree with Tiese's groaning voice, but if you are able to do so, it’s rather worth trying to invoke Kirito’s "Pick of Mind". Looked around, for something like a long bar, but there was no such thing falling conveniently.

But, on the other hand, they’d need to find a bar about 3 mel length, to take the key out from the outside, so it appears to be an unlikely story to happen. *If you keep a duplicate key, why should it stay so far down the staircase?*

When Ronye thought again, what on earth this building is exactly, that happened.

That moment they heard the dragon's roaring "Ku-ru-ru-ru.......". Looking down, they saw the light-blue feathered Shimosaki trying to thrust his body into the gap in the grid. Tiese who saw it asked, worriedly:

"Hey Shimosaki, you think you can get through this gap...?"

But before she finished, Tsukigake’s head showed Shimosaki's back. The body of the young dragon passed through the gap at once, and after one full somersault, it stood up in front of the staircase.

"Kyu-ru-ru!!!"

Shimosaki proudly chirped, and although some rust stuck to its feathers, there seemed to be no injury. It looked wide due to fluffy fur and feathers, but the body of the young dragon in reality was still small.

"Good grief, what a self-esteem......."

Tiese lightly scolded him, but a smile of proudness appeared on her lips. Pointing at the key with her right hand thrusted into the iron grid, she instructed the beloved dragon:

"Shimosaki, can you get it?"

Of course, chirping again in the response, Shimosaki went down the stairs and stopped right under the nail.

The height to the key was about 1.8 mel. While leisurely flapping small wings, it jumped once, twice and succeeded in picking up the key at the third time. After coming back to triumphantly, it protruded a thin nose through the grid gap.

Tiese received the key held in the mouth, handed it over to Ronye, and began stroking the head of the dragon with both hands. Who, after observing the scene, inserted the old key into the keyhole of the iron grating. Although, as expected, it was bit hard, the key eventually turned around, then a click and a hard sound echoed.

She waited for Tiese to go one step back and pulled the grid towards herself. The door moved squeaking **ki-i-i-i**. Shimosaki who was waiting inside flapped the wings as soon as they came in.

Since the door was opened, they had to find out what was in the basement, but once again looking into the darkness under the stairs, Ronye felt sweat spreading over her palms.

*I do not like the disjunctive way the high-priority iron grid key was hanging just out of reach. I do not think it is a trap to lure an intruder into the basement — but if so, they wouldn’t have to lock it, to start with — and I cannot predict what is inside so far.*

Ronye lifted the line of sight from Tsukigake, rubbing its body against the feet as if sharing the owner's anxiety, to Tiese, and suggested:

"Hey, Tiese. I will check it down, so you can stay here..."

"Declined, I will go too, of course."

She distinctly shook her head, denying the option to wait outside with the dragons.

"……all right. But be careful, OK?"

"Sure."

Saying so Tiese encouragingly smiled, and Ronye smiled in response and walked up to the bush on the left. Chose a branch without thorns and broke it. Generated a light element and fixed it to the leaf at the tip of the branch by the "**adhere**" phrase.

Embracing Tsukigake with the left arm, she raised the newly-created torch with her right hand and stepped into the building. After waiting for Tiese and Shimosaki to enter, she closed the door and locked it again. She could bring the key along, but it might indicate the intrusion, so she returned it to the nail which was located just beneath the ground level.

The descending stairs were longer than could be imagined. There was a landing after they descended thirty steps, and then it went for another thirty, where it finally turned into a flat aisle. Since the height of one step was about 20 cen, it could be counted as about 12 mels underground. For Cathedral, that would be equal to a height of a third floor.

The air was somewhat warmer than outside, but also damp and moldy. In truth, they first thought that there might be a hidden treasure chest of the emperor Norlangarth stored in the basement, but if someone keeps it in such a place, the treasure box will lose its Life in a few years and it will decay into trash.

After about 50 meters, the long underground passageway turned to the right. Finally, they saw a weak light ahead. But it was not a relief. Whatever the light source was, there must be someone who ignited it.

There was still a distance of over 30 mel to the light, but Ronye saw the other one giving her a sign and stopped. No noise or talk could be heard at that moment. When she carefully tried to resume advancement, her cloak hood was lightly pulled behind.

She startled, winced and turned around.

"……What's wrong?"

To that whispered question, Tiese looked up at the ceiling of the aisle with a difficult expression. Ronye also looked upwards, but she could only see the same stone-cladding as the wall was made of.

Tiese muttered, frowning:

"Went from the backyard northwest, entered the forest... descended from that small shrine to the basement, turned back once....... ── Ronye, is this not the basement of the mansion by any chance?"

"Ehm…………"

After hearing her words, Ronye also imagined the plan of the manor and the forest. She nodded slowly after blinking.

"Yeah, that's right...... what is wrong with that?"

"Because...... isn’t it weird? If it's a basement of a mansion, you only need to make a staircase to the building... Why would you have an entrance in the forest several tens of mels away?"

*To say the truth, Tiese's made a good point. Again, a sense of discomfort revived after thoughts of a key fitting to the metal grid hanging near the entrance, but even if you think it all over, the answer will not come out.*

"Maybe we'll find out if we take a look at what’s down there..."

When Ronye responded in whispering, her partner muttered "well...". After all that happened so far, they couldn’t turn back without having checked every corner of the basement.

After this exchange, two people with two animals began tiptoeing south along the passage.



## To be continued...

## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>It is the default for western world that dragons fly. That’s why no translators of SAO I ever read made an accent on it. However, in Japan, the dragon (竜, ryū) defaults to a prolonged Chinese dragon, which may not necessary fly at all. In these books all “dragons” of Integrity Knights, i.e. all dragons in Underworld — except, perhaps, for that legendary one depicted on the magic comb Asuna used — are “flying dragons” (飛竜, hiryū), which are more the traditional “euro-standard” dragons. Further I will continue to use just word “dragon” referring to the dragons we all know.
2. <a name="Prim2"></a>Tiese uses ansoku-nichi (安息日) which has a distinct meaning of Judaic Sabbath, but since it’s kanji and not katakana, she probably doesn’t refer to the name of day itself, nor to a term (as Underworld people know nothing of other religions), but rather to the fact that it’s the last day of week when people rest.
3. <a name="Prim3"></a>I guess あっやしいなぁー can also mean that she doesn’t like the whole idea in the first place, and in fact it’s probably both.
4. <a name="Prim4"></a>Yes I am aware it’s still late February, several days after snow melted.
5. <a name="Prim5"></a>Ronye doesn’t know about a concept of ‘poncho’ so here we have ‘cloak’ in her thoughts. Same for ‘O-nata’ (Great Knife of Pyramidhead from Silent Hill) becoming ‘kyodaina-nata’, (simply huge hatchet) below.
6. <a name="Prim6"></a>The original says “lowered” but given both girls should be under 160 cm (you remember the 180 cm "giant", don't you?), you’ll have nightmares if you try imagining that.
