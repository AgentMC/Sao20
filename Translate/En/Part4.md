# Part 4

When Ronye came to dragon stables two hours later than usual, Tsukigake greeted her with a slightly unhappy cry.

"Kyu-ru-ru-ru!!!"

"Sorry, sorry, I am late."

As soon as she opened a fence of about 1 mel height, the young dragon covered in pale-yellow fur rushed to her flapping small wings. Caught with both arms, it aggressively pushed it’s rounded square-like grown head to the neck of Ronye.

Nearby, Tiese got the similar unhappy greeting from Shimosaki. Both of them are still not large enough so one can hold them, but it will not be possible next year.

"Arabel-dono, is everything all right?"

Suddenly a voice sounded behind, and Ronye startlingly looked back.

There was tall and thin man standing there. He was wearing unusual clothes with many clasps where both upper and lower parts were tailored with a strange fabric reminiscent of small scales, and many large and small leather bags were hanging on his waistband. In his right hand he was holding a long spear-like wooden handle but attached to the head was not a metal tip a but a large brush of hard hair.

His shabby face looked somewhat older than Dusolbert’s, but the actual age was not clear. This person had long been a keeper in dragon stables of Cathedral and his Life has been frozen just like Airy’s...... there was such a rumor.

"Yes, I guess so, Hainag-san."

When Ronye nodded, the stable worker extended his slender, yet, upon closer look, quite stubborn right hand, pushing it under the chin of the young dragon.

"Recently I gave some fish to Tsukigake, it wasn’t a lot, but she still left some. Dragons, of course, have individual food preferences, but there’s no chance one can choose food in the battlefield, so you’d better correct this behavior while she’s still young."

"Oh... is that so? Hey, Tsukigake, there’s no good in being picky, you know?"

When the Ronye softly scolded her, the young dragon, as if understanding the words, pushed its head and feathery ears down and said "Kyuuun".

"Well, what should I do to correct this fish disliking?"

"The most effective thing would be to let them catch fish by themselves. If they eat freshly caught fish the issue usually gets fixed immediately, but it is difficult to have this within Cathedral. Previously, I was excused by Bercouli-dono to take a young dragon to a lake outside the city."

"F-Fresh, freshly caught you say... Well then, I will ask knight chief Fanatio or Kirito-sen... or the Prime Swordsman-sama for the permission."

"Please do so. And now please excuse me."

Having briefly bowed, Hainag the dragon stable keeper walked away to the dragon compartment in the back. Tiese who overheard the talk as she was taking care of her dragon nearby said:

"... are they supposed to catch fish by themselves?"

"I wonder if they can swim in the first place..."

As they tilted their heads in the same way, both dragons which understood they will be taken to a walk outside started to happily swing their tails.

"It seems so."

For the time being, they left the stables and let the dragons onto the lawn surrounding the building. Immediately, those two began running around the grass while squealing noisily.

*As I see this happening, naturally a wide smile emerges on my lips, but I just don’t feel like running around together with them. Even now, somewhere on the upper floors of Cathedral, Kirito and Asuna continue discussions with the senior knights.*

*The true identity of the person who called himself an official of the South Centoria administration and took the three mountain goblins by the carriage could not be clarified with the available guards. Although we were able to meet the guardian of the room, he only said that the administrative seal was certainly pressed in the goblins transportation order the person produced.*

*Then we had to contact the administration directly, but it was not so easy. The administrations of the four cities are still under the heavy influence of the former senior aristocracy and they tend to oppose the Human World Union Council; in particular, the South Centoria administration officials displayed a stiff attitude to forcibly close the case of Yazen's murder. Kirito and others judged that an official order was needed to investigate the matter of the transfer and returned to the Cathedral to prepare the documents from the Union Council and Integrity Knights name.*

*I do not think that Fanatio or Dusolbert would oppose giving an investigation order to the administration. Because, Kirito already is almost convinced that both the order form and the official seen there were fakes. The problem is the behavioral guideline given. Kirito feels responsible for having the goblins kidnapped, and he would try to raise the search and rescue them. But since the life of the Prime Swordsman has just been targeted at Obsidia Castle recently, Fanatio and others must also strongly argue that he should remain quiet this time.*

"...... the Council, they will be against him......."

Tiese, who seemed to think the same thing, muttered next to her, and Ronye nodded:

"It may continue tomorrow."

"I hope senpai does not get out in the middle of the night..."

*That is quite likely to happen.  
I would like Kirito to act freely, but as his valet in the past, I must make sure he stays on the spot when detained.* Looking up at the large tower of chalk, Ronye said:

"I will ask Asuna-sama...... to keep an eye on senpai."

Tiese who heard that seemed to try saying something, but the words did not flow so she just breathed out. She briefly glared at the one nearby, and finally mumbled a word keeping doubtful expression:

"……what?"

"No, nothing."

As two of them were having such a conversation, the young dragons let out a dissatisfied cry. Meaning the two of them should join the chase.

"All right but be ready for the hard time!"

Having cried so, Ronye began chasing Tsukigake and Shimosaki.
