How many minutes — how many hours have actually passed?

There was no way to know the current time in a dungeon which had not a single window and no Centoria time bells could be heard either. Prime Swordsman used to say "I'd like to finish the wearable watch as soon as possible", but though he tested a lot of prototypes with head engineer Sadore, it seemed to be far from complete.

Every time Ronye heard that words, she secretly thought, *since the time bell tells the exact time, why would it be necessary to carry bulky equipment......* but after getting in such a situation she had no choice but to change her mind.

Also, the melody that the thousands of bells all over Human World play was a hymn called "Under the light of Solus". It was a beautiful piece of music, but knowing that the history of the Axiom Church is covered with countless lies, listening to a hymn it’s quite difficult to sincerely praise gods as it was before.

The art in Human World such as music, painting, sculpture and poetry were still severely restricted by the Taboo Index. It was only those who were given the sacred task of an artist could advance the artistic path, and they must also undergo a judgment by the Imperial Government before the work is announced. If the content even slightly denies the genesis myth or Axiom Church, or is excessively entertaining, it gets banned.

Prime Swordsman wanted to immediately deprecate the screening system, but the idea was fought back by the Union Council — specifically, as expected, by Integrity Knight Nergius — so it has not come true yet. It was still a little difficult question for Ronye, but she thought that it will be good when time comes for people to sing songs, paint pictures and write stories freely without being bound by any screening.

*In order to see such an era, we must survive and escape from here.*

Almost at the same time as Ronye reconsolidated her resolve again, the quiet sound echoed:

"Ugh, it's useless......."

Tiese, who was attempting the "Pick of Mind " in front of the iron gate, flopped to the floor.

"Kirito-senpai would probably have opened in no time..."

Although it was a crisis situation, unexpectedly Ronye bitterly smiled to her best friend's words.

"Hey, you cannot do the same thing as the senpai so easily"

"That's right, but... how about you?"

She returned a silent denial to that whispered question.

While her best friend was trying the Pick of Mind, Ronye was looking over the dungeon walls, but as expected no hidden door or a destructible location could be found. It was impossible to quietly extract the Northern Empire granite stone forming a wall without even a 1 mil gap, even with the power of apprentice knights, and if you try to forcibly destroy walls or grating the sound would be transmitted to the mansion above.

Tiese who finally raised her body, sat hugging her knees and said as if to herself:

"Shimosaki, you all right there?"

It was the fourth time she sighed out the same question. Still, Ronye kneeled next to her best friend and answered gently stroking her back:

"Sure he’s okay. We’ll meet soon."

While rubbing the back of Tiese who was silently nodding, Ronye also pondered about Tsukigake inside her mind.

Between the mansion and the Centoria North Gate, there were some hills, but all-in-all there were just flat plains alternating with former direct jurisdiction farms. Ronye was not familiar with the state of private territories but she though there couldn’t be any animals capable of fighting small dragons there. She could not say there was absolutely no possibility of encountering an unexpected danger, so Ronye only hoped for Tsukigake to arrive safely.

*── Gods-sama.*

Even though she knew that neither the gods’ world in the sky nor the gods themselves living there existed, Ronye devoted her heartfelt prayer.

*── Please, please take care of Tsukigake and Shimosaki.*

She could not hear a voice answering.

Instead, she heard the sound of heavy rocks rubbing against each other.

The thick stone wall illuminated by the lanterns was slowly rising up on the left side of the passage. Ronye and Tiese winced, abruptly stood up and went closer to the back wall. In the adjacent cell, the mountain goblins let out screams in multiple voices.

The one who slowly, as if seeping out of the darkness behind the completely raised door, appeared was a man in a black robe called Zeppos by Emperor Krueger.

The man walked through the aisle while chinking the key ring hanging on his right and stopped in front of the cell with Ronye and the other one. He peered inside with a gentle movement, his gaze from behind the hood glided over the two of them, then without saying a word he returned to the previous movement. Went forward several steps and stopped again in front of the next cell.

Is it just a patrol, thought Ronye and carefully got closer to the grate to watch the man. The man then inserted into one in the bunch of keys into the lock.

**Ga-chin**, echoed the cold sound, and the goblins raised frightened voices again. The man who opened the door without hesitation declared with a strangely distorted voice:

"Animals, all three of you, get out of the cell."

The goblins squeaking immediately seized. A quiet whispering voice asked:

"You us...... let out?"

After about three seconds, Zeppos answered "yes".

Ronye felt it was a lie. The silence was unnatural, and he could not just release the goblins whom they abducted from the inn in Southern Centoria with a great deal of trouble.

But the mountain goblins came out of the cell without showing suspicion of doubting the words of the man.

"Proceed to that door."

— said Zeppos said, pointing at the hidden door on the left side, not the right side where there was an exit to the surface. The three of them quietly obeyed and began walking. As if blocking the escape route, Zeppos followed behind.

The moment when the man was passing in front of a grate, Ronye could not stand it and said:

"What are you going to do with those people?"

The goblins stopped and turned their looks at Ronye; they seemed to fully believe the promise to release, so looked disappointed and sorry. Behind them, Zeppos blasted with a squeaking laughter:

"Ku-ku...... ‘people’, you say?"

"What's funny?"

It was Tiese who asked it. Zeppos twisted his body again and after looking into the prison replied with a smile.

"Goblins remain goblins until they run out of Life, no matter how much the world changes."

Ronye thought she already heard these words somewhere. But before the memory came out to her, Zeppos came back to senses and ordered the three ahead:

"Now move, go up the stairs and I'll let you out."

The figures of Zeppos and the goblins who resorted to move forward timidly dissolved in the darkness behind the secret door. The sound of four footsteps moved up the stone stairs, and also disappeared. Finally, a ‘**Gii!**’ sound shrieked, and the silence returned to the dungeon.

"............ really, they’ve got no reason to release them, huh......"

— whispered Tiese, and Ronye had no choice but to nod.

"Perhaps... something is ready. I do not know what it is.... but I'm sure it is somehow related to goblins-san."

When she responded in a whispering, Tiese touched her lips for a moment and said with tighter expression.

"Kirito-senpai said that the kidnappers will commit another murder in Centoria and that he will frame the abducted goblins-san again. If so...... innocent people will be killed in Centoria again."

"…………Yup……"

While nodding again, Ronye thought hard.

If her friend’s guess is right, whom the kidnappers — who are emperor Krueger and Zeppos, are going to kill?

Kirito was also saying this as well.

If the culprit was able to violate the Taboo Index and kill Yazen-san because he was a former private territory dweller, other former serfs could be killed in the same way.

Prime Swordsman thought so because he could hear the voice of the murderer in Asuna's "past reflection art". The words of the culprit just before killing the old Yazen.

*── Serfs of my territory belong to my territory until they run out of Life, so if you tend to dislike that, then right here enjoy the death granted.*

"…………Ah!"

— exclaimed Ronye as Zeppos’ voice heard just a few minutes ago revived in her mind.

*── Goblins remain goblins until they run out of Life.*

Just because the subject is different, exactly the same phrase.

That's it. Too weak for the evidence, purely circumstantial. But Ronye believed her intuition was correct.

"...... That guy called Zeppos is the culprit who killed Yazen-san in the inn."

As she said so in a shivering voice, Tiese who also felt the same, nodded deeply with a tight expression.

"Yeah.... I feel that too, don’t know how far he can break the Taboo Index, but he’ll definitely try to use goblins-san to cause a more serious incident than the one of Yazen-san's case. We must stop him as soon as possible."

"Eeeh..."

While muttering, Ronye gazed at the darkness behind the secret door on the other side of the grid.

*I do not know how much exactly time has elapsed, but if everything went well, about now Tsukigake would be arriving at the Northern gate of Centoria. But, of course she<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup> cannot speak in human language. A gatekeeper guard will notice that Tsukigake is a little dragon, will send a message to the Cathedral, a report will reach someone like Kirito or Asuna, or an Integrity Knight, and it will take tens of minutes for help to come to this location ──*

Moreover, the carriage which Ronye and Tiese rode on was parked on the eastern bank of the lake. It would be impossible for Prime Swordsman or anyone else to guess that two of them are held in a dungeon of a mansion in the forest on its west bank. The only hope was to expect that Tsukigake would guide the rescue team, but it also takes time, and overall it was clear that it will take at least an hour to get help no matter how optimistic estimations are.

*It would be too naïve to think that until then nothing will happen to the goblins that were taken to the upper floor. If we do not act now, it will be too late.*

But it is impossible to quietly destroy this sturdy grid. In the first place it is unknown whether it can be broken by the power of the two people, but even if we just try it, a loud sound will reach the mansion above and the emperor would notice. If so, I do not know what hostage Shimosaki will face.

Unable to come up with an answer, Ronye closed her eyes.

*I felt this feeling just a week ago. In the Obsidia Castle of Dark Territory which we visited with Kirito, Lisetta, the only daughter of Isukan General Commander and Ambassador Scheta, was kidnapped and kidnappers requested Kirito's public execution. If it’s not done by sunset, Lisetta's Life would have been zeroed.*

As the time limit was approaching, Ronye lost her serenity and firmly insisted in front of Kirito. If Kirito chooses to be executed, she will also be executed with him.

To that words of Ronye, Kirito said:

*── I will not give up. I’ll certainly save Lisetta. And then, we’ll return to Cathedral together with Ronye. To the place of our home...*

*Yes, you must not give up. Do not just wait for everything to resolve with Tsukigake alone, but think hard what you can do now. There must be a way that will not result in sacrificing both goblins and Shimosaki.*

"... Tiese"

The same moment Ronye whispered, her best friend said as well:

"Let's break the iron grid."

"Eh!…"

What was considered the last resort has suddenly been proposed first and foremost, and Ronye involuntarily protested:

"B-but, if the sounds are heard above, Shimosaki......."

Then Tiese interrupted her with a gesture of understanding, and then glanced at the dungeon ceiling.

"...... I guess there are not so many people in this mansion. Maybe, only two: the emperor and Zeppos...... If so, the emperor won’t bother taking the risk of countering us."

Indeed, at that time Emperor Krueger continued to attract their attention as a decoy until Zeppos creeped out from behind of Ronye and caught Shimosaki. If there were others or minions around, he would have made a decoy of them.

"Well... it seems so..."

"If there are only two of them, I think we can secure Shimosaki if we attack suddenly. Fortunately, our swords should be left just behind the secret door."

"............"

Ronye stared at the darkness behind the secret door.

The drawn swords that the two of them dropped on the floor were kicked to the other side of the door by emperor Krueger, but there was no evidence that they were taken from there to the upper floors. Should they be able to escape from the cell, there was a high chance of retrieving the swords back right away.

*If I have my beloved sword, even if that one was a genuine Emperor Krueger, I do not feel like losing. But, again, I am worried about Shimosaki. Even if there are only two enemies there, it is necessary to at least know where he is kept in the mansion in advance to rescue him with surprise attack as Tiese suggested.*

"Tiese."

While standing in front of her best friend, Ronye lifted her hands:

"Lend a hand."

"Eh……?"

She firmly grasped the hands the other one raised with bewildered expression on the face.

"Trying to open locks with incarnation is unreasonable, it perhaps we can try incarnational sensivity."

When the Ronye said this, Tiese opened her autumn leaves colored eyes wide.

The training of the incarnational power emphasized the "ability to perceive" as much as the "ability to influence". The training of "Tanza mind wiping", which the two of them were struggling with, was all about sitting on the training ground, closing the eyes, blanking the mind, and attempting to broaden the perceptual power by the incarnation.

Kirito, who had the greatest power of incarnation in Human World, said "If your opponent is a dragon, you can sense it even if you are 10 kilolu away", but Ronye and herself did not even sense humans within the same room. And now it was about locating a small dragon through a thick stone ceiling. Although it seemed reckless, there was no other way to find Shimosaki's location.

Tiese, who thought this way, wanted to say something for a moment, but quickly squeezed lips. Grasped Ronye’s hands and meditated.

Ronye closed her eyes too and quietly inhaled the cold dungeon air. Tiese in front of her also breathed in. Held it for precisely 1 second, then slowly exhaled.

Although the incarnational power was an individual strength, it can be maxed out by the state of "the unity of body and soul" which is achievable by breathing synchronously with someone while holding their hands. With that being quite an advanced technique, even together with such a close friend as Tiese they have only succeeded in it several times in the past. However, the power of one person would probably be not enough to pierce the ceiling with incarnational sensing.

The breathing of two deepened with every inhale. The sensation of touching each other’s skin melted, the distance dissolved. The boundary between themselves and the outside world gradually faded little by little, as the perception range spread.

*I can feel three are present almost directly above the dungeon. It seems they are lying side by side. This would be three mountain Goblins.*

*Two presences somewhere away. They are felt so cold as it cannot be thought of a living human being, that must be emperor Krueger and Zeppos.*

And there was a small but very warm presence in the corner of the same room. As soon as they perceived it, Tiese’s breathing became slightly disrupted. For a moment, the overlapping incarnational fields fluctuated but quickly regained stability. They sensed Shimosaki's feelings of anxiety and tension, but there was no sign of a major injury.

The sensing range extended further. They can vaguely perceive the layout of the mansion. It was only referred to as an imperial villa, however on both the first floor and the second floor there were many rooms; luckily, all the other halls except the one with five people and Shimosaki seemed to be unmanned.

*If we climb the stairs behind the secret door out of the dungeon, we’d get to a room that seems to be a storage on the first floor of the mansion, from there the door of the hall is just 5 meters away via the corridor. If two of us run with full power, it’s fifteen — no, just ten seconds.*

Ronye and Tiese lifted the eyelids at the same time and stared each other's eyes.

No words were needed. They let go of hands and turned to the iron grid.

It would be difficult to destroy it with bare hands, but the swords’ sheaths, which were quite robust too, were left on the waists of both. Priorities of those did not reach the swords’ ones, but they should endure a single slash.

"... Hey, do you remember? The way Yujio-senpai and Kirito-senpai escaped from Cathedral's dungeon."

— Tiese suddenly whispered, Ronye blinked to that.

"Of course. They cut the divine iron chains, and using them broke the grid."

"When I heard that story, I thought, man our senpais are tough, but... no way I could ever imagine we would do the same thing."

"Me too."

A momentary smile wiped out, and Ronye with clasp removed the empty sheath from the sword belt with her left hand. Pased it to the right hand and raised it vertically. Tiese next to her made perfectly identical movement.

*I do not know what the emperor and Zeppos are doing to the goblins in the hall above. However, if we take the next step, we cannot lose even a second.*

*…………sorry.*

After apologizing to the sheath in my mind, Ronye sharply breathed in.

*One cannot use secret moves with a sheath, but I will just hit as much as I can.*

"Haaah!"

"Yaaaa!"

With the increasingly loud screams, two people sharply swung down empty sheaths performing Norkia style secret move "Lightning slash", also known as Incrad style secret move "Vertical".

It was probably an illusion that the sheath made of wood and leather felt wrapped in faint blue light. The two sheaths crashed into the steel grid and crumbled it down to pieces with a tremendous pulsing sound.
