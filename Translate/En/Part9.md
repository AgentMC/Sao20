How many minutes — how many hours have actually passed?

There was no way to know the current time in a dungeon which had not a single window and no Centoria time bells could be heard either. Prime Swordsman used to say "I'd like to finish the wearable watch as soon as possible", but though he tested a lot of prototypes with head engineer Sadore, it seemed to be far from complete.

Every time Ronye heard that words, she secretly thought, *since the time bell tells the exact time, why would it be necessary to carry bulky equipment......* but after getting in such a situation she had no choice but to change her mind.

Also, the melody that the thousands of bells all over Human World play was a hymn called "Under the light of Solus". It was a beautiful piece of music, but knowing that the history of the Axiom Church is covered with countless lies, listening to a hymn it’s quite difficult to sincerely praise gods as it was before.

The art in Human World such as music, painting, sculpture and poetry were still severely restricted by the Taboo Index. It was only those who were given the sacred task of an artist could advance the artistic path, and they must also undergo a judgment by the Imperial Government before the work is announced. If the content even slightly denies the genesis myth or Axiom Church, or is excessively entertaining, it gets banned.

Prime Swordsman wanted to immediately deprecate the screening system, but the idea was fought back by the Union Council — specifically, as expected, by Integrity Knight Nergius — so it has not come true yet. It was still a little difficult question for Ronye, but she thought that it will be good when time comes for people to sing songs, paint pictures and write stories freely without being bound by any screening.

*In order to see such an era, we must survive and escape from here.*

Almost at the same time as Ronye reconsolidated her resolve again, the quiet sound echoed:

"Ugh, it's useless......."

Tiese, who was attempting the "Pick of Mind " in front of the iron gate, flopped to the floor.

"Kirito-senpai would probably have opened in no time..."

Although it was a crisis situation, unexpectedly Ronye bitterly smiled to her best friend's words.

"Hey, you cannot do the same thing as the senpai so easily"

"That's right, but... how about you?"

She returned a silent denial to that whispered question.

While her best friend was trying the Pick of Mind, Ronye was looking over the dungeon walls, but as expected no hidden door or a destructible location could be found. It was impossible to quietly extract the Northern Empire granite stone forming a wall without even a 1 mil gap, even with the power of apprentice knights, and if you try to forcibly destroy walls or grating the sound would be transmitted to the mansion above.

Tiese who finally raised her body, sat hugging her knees and said as if to herself:

"Shimosaki, you all right there?"

It was the fourth time she sighed out the same question. Still, Ronye kneeled next to her best friend and answered gently stroking her back:

"Sure he’s okay. We’ll meet soon."

While rubbing the back of Tiese who was silently nodding, Ronye also pondered about Tsukigake inside her mind.

Between the mansion and the Centoria North Gate, there were some hills, but all-in-all there were just flat plains alternating with former direct jurisdiction farms. Ronye was not familiar with the state of private territories but she though there couldn’t be any animals capable of fighting small dragons there. She could not say there was absolutely no possibility of encountering an unexpected danger, so Ronye only hoped for Tsukigake to arrive safely.

*── Gods-sama.*

Even though she knew that neither the gods’ world in the sky nor the gods themselves living there existed, Ronye devoted her heartfelt prayer.

*── Please, please take care of Tsukigake and Shimosaki.*

She could not hear a voice answering.

Instead, she heard the sound of heavy rocks rubbing against each other.

The thick stone wall illuminated by the lanterns was slowly rising up on the left side of the passage. Ronye and Tiese winced, abruptly stood up and went closer to the back wall. In the adjacent cell, the mountain goblins let out screams in multiple voices.

The one who slowly, as if seeping out of the darkness behind the completely raised door, appeared was a man in a black robe called Zeppos by Emperor Krueger.

The man walked through the aisle while chinking the key ring hanging on his right and stopped in front of the cell with Ronye and the other one. He peered inside with a gentle movement, his gaze from behind the hood glided over the two of them, then without saying a word he returned to the previous movement. Went forward several steps and stopped again in front of the next cell.

Is it just a patrol, thought Ronye and carefully got closer to the grate to watch the man. The man then inserted into one in the bunch of keys into the lock.

**Ga-chin**, echoed the cold sound, and the goblins raised frightened voices again. The man who opened the door without hesitation declared with a strangely distorted voice:

"Animals, all three of you, get out of the cell."

The goblins squeaking immediately seized. A quiet whispering voice asked:

"You us...... let out?"

After about three seconds, Zeppos answered "yes".

Ronye felt it was a lie. The silence was unnatural, and he could not just release the goblins whom they abducted from the inn in Southern Centoria with a great deal of trouble.

But the mountain goblins came out of the cell without showing suspicion of doubting the words of the man.

"Proceed to that door."

— said Zeppos said, pointing at the hidden door on the left side, not the right side where there was an exit to the surface. The three of them quietly obeyed and began walking. As if blocking the escape route, Zeppos followed behind.

The moment when the man was passing in front of a grate, Ronye could not stand it and said:

"What are you going to do with those people?"

The goblins stopped and turned their looks at Ronye; they seemed to fully believe the promise to release, so looked disappointed and sorry. Behind them, Zeppos blasted with a squeaking laughter:

"Ku-ku...... ‘people’, you say?"

"What's funny?"

It was Tiese who asked it. Zeppos twisted his body again and after looking into the prison replied with a smile.

"Goblins remain goblins until they run out of Life, no matter how much the world changes."

Ronye thought she already heard these words somewhere. But before the memory came out to her, Zeppos came back to senses and ordered the three ahead:

"Now move, go up the stairs and I'll let you out."

The figures of Zeppos and the goblins who resorted to move forward timidly dissolved in the darkness behind the secret door. The sound of four footsteps moved up the stone stairs, and also disappeared. Finally, a ‘**Gii!**’ sound shrieked, and the silence returned to the dungeon.

"............ really, they’ve got no reason to release them, huh......"

— whispered Tiese, and Ronye had no choice but to nod.

"Perhaps... something is ready. I do not know what it is.... but I'm sure it is somehow related to goblins-san."

When she responded in a whispering, Tiese touched her lips for a moment and said with tighter expression.

"Kirito-senpai said that the kidnappers will commit another murder in Centoria and that he will frame the abducted goblins-san again. If so...... innocent people will be killed in Centoria again."

"…………Yup……"

While nodding again, Ronye thought hard.

If her friend’s guess is right, whom the kidnappers — who are emperor Krueger and Zeppos, are going to kill?

Kirito was also saying this as well.

If the culprit was able to violate the Taboo Index and kill Yazen-san because he was a former private territory dweller, other former serfs could be killed in the same way.

Prime Swordsman thought so because he could hear the voice of the murderer in Asuna's "past reflection art". The words of the culprit just before killing the old Yazen.

*── Serfs of my territory belong to my territory until they run out of Life, so if you tend to dislike that, then right here enjoy the death granted.*

"…………Ah!"

— exclaimed Ronye as Zeppos’ voice heard just a few minutes ago revived in her mind.

*── Goblins remain goblins until they run out of Life.*

Just because the subject is different, exactly the same phrase.

That's it. Too weak for the evidence, purely circumstantial. But Ronye believed her intuition was correct.

"...... That guy called Zeppos is the culprit who killed Yazen-san in the inn."

As she said so in a shivering voice, Tiese who also felt the same, nodded deeply with a tight expression.

"Yeah.... I feel that too, don’t know how far he can break the Taboo Index, but he’ll definitely try to use goblins-san to cause a more serious incident than the one of Yazen-san's case. We must stop him as soon as possible."

"Eeeh..."

While muttering, Ronye gazed at the darkness behind the secret door on the other side of the grid.

*I do not know how much exactly time has elapsed, but if everything went well, about now Tsukigake would be arriving at the Northern gate of Centoria. But, of course she<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup> cannot speak in human language. A gatekeeper guard will notice that Tsukigake is a little dragon, will send a message to the Cathedral, a report will reach someone like Kirito or Asuna, or an Integrity Knight, and it will take tens of minutes for help to come to this location ──*

Moreover, the carriage which Ronye and Tiese rode on was parked on the eastern bank of the lake. It would be impossible for Prime Swordsman or anyone else to guess that two of them are held in a dungeon of a mansion in the forest on its west bank. The only hope was to expect that Tsukigake would guide the rescue team, but it also takes time, and overall it was clear that it will take at least an hour to get help no matter how optimistic estimations are.

*It would be too naïve to think that until then nothing will happen to the goblins that were taken to the upper floor. If we do not act now, it will be too late.*

But it is impossible to quietly destroy this sturdy grid. In the first place it is unknown whether it can be broken by the power of the two people, but even if we just try it, a loud sound will reach the mansion above and the emperor would notice. If so, I do not know what hostage Shimosaki will face.

Unable to come up with an answer, Ronye closed her eyes.

*I felt this feeling just a week ago. In the Obsidia Castle of Dark Territory which we visited with Kirito, Lisetta, the only daughter of Isukan General Commander and Ambassador Scheta, was kidnapped and kidnappers requested Kirito's public execution. If it’s not done by sunset, Lisetta's Life would have been zeroed.*

As the time limit was approaching, Ronye lost her serenity and firmly insisted in front of Kirito. If Kirito chooses to be executed, she will also be executed with him.

To that words of Ronye, Kirito said:

*── I will not give up. I’ll certainly save Lisetta. And then, we’ll return to Cathedral together with Ronye. To the place of our home...*

*Yes, you must not give up. Do not just wait for everything to resolve with Tsukigake alone, but think hard what you can do now. There must be a way that will not result in sacrificing both goblins and Shimosaki.*

"... Tiese"

The same moment Ronye whispered, her best friend said as well:

"Let's break the iron grid."

"Eh!…"

What was considered the last resort has suddenly been proposed first and foremost, and Ronye involuntarily protested:

"B-but, if the sounds are heard above, Shimosaki......."

Then Tiese interrupted her with a gesture of understanding, and then glanced at the dungeon ceiling.

"...... I guess there are not so many people in this mansion. Maybe, only two: the emperor and Zeppos...... If so, the emperor won’t bother taking the risk of countering us."

Indeed, at that time Emperor Krueger continued to attract their attention as a decoy until Zeppos creeped out from behind of Ronye and caught Shimosaki. If there were others or minions around, he would have made a decoy of them.

"Well... it seems so..."

"If there are only two of them, I think we can secure Shimosaki if we attack suddenly. Fortunately, our swords should be left just behind the secret door."

"............"

Ronye stared at the darkness behind the secret door.

The drawn swords that the two of them dropped on the floor were kicked to the other side of the door by emperor Krueger, but there was no evidence that they were taken from there to the upper floors. Should they be able to escape from the cell, there was a high chance of retrieving the swords back right away.

*If I have my beloved sword, even if that one was a genuine Emperor Krueger, I do not feel like losing. But, again, I am worried about Shimosaki. Even if there are only two enemies there, it is necessary to at least know where he is kept in the mansion in advance to rescue him with surprise attack as Tiese suggested.*

"Tiese."

While standing in front of her best friend, Ronye lifted her hands:

"Lend a hand."

"Eh……?"

She firmly grasped the hands the other one raised with bewildered expression on the face.

"Trying to open locks with incarnation is unreasonable, it perhaps we can try incarnational sensivity."

When the Ronye said this, Tiese opened her autumn leaves colored eyes wide.

The training of the incarnational power emphasized the "ability to perceive" as much as the "ability to influence". The training of "Tanza mind wiping", which the two of them were struggling with, was all about sitting on the training ground, closing the eyes, blanking the mind, and attempting to broaden the perceptual power by the incarnation.

Kirito, who had the greatest power of incarnation in Human World, said "If your opponent is a dragon, you can sense it even if you are 10 kilolu away", but Ronye and herself did not even sense humans within the same room. And now it was about locating a small dragon through a thick stone ceiling. Although it seemed reckless, there was no other way to find Shimosaki's location.

Tiese, who thought this way, wanted to say something for a moment, but quickly squeezed lips. Grasped Ronye’s hands and meditated.

Ronye closed her eyes too and quietly inhaled the cold dungeon air. Tiese in front of her also breathed in. Held it for precisely 1 second, then slowly exhaled.

Although the incarnational power was an individual strength, it can be maxed out by the state of "the spiritual unity" which is achievable by breathing synchronously with someone while holding their hands. With that being quite an advanced technique, even together with such a close friend as Tiese they have only succeeded in it several times in the past. However, the power of one person would probably be not enough to pierce the ceiling with incarnational sensing.

The breathing of two deepened with every inhale. The sensation of touching each other’s skin melted, the distance dissolved. The boundary between themselves and the outside world gradually faded little by little, as the perception range spread.

*I can feel three are present almost directly above the dungeon. It seems they are lying side by side. This would be three mountain Goblins.*

*Two presences somewhere away. They are felt so cold as it cannot be thought of a living human being, that must be emperor Krueger and Zeppos.*

And there was a small but very warm presence in the corner of the same room. As soon as they perceived it, Tiese’s breathing became slightly disrupted. For a moment, the overlapping incarnational fields fluctuated but quickly regained stability. They sensed Shimosaki's feelings of anxiety and tension, but there was no sign of a major injury.

The sensing range extended further. They can vaguely perceive the layout of the mansion. It was only referred to as an imperial villa, however on both the first floor and the second floor there were many rooms; luckily, all the other halls except the one with five people and Shimosaki seemed to be unmanned.

*If we climb the stairs behind the secret door out of the dungeon, we’d get to a room that seems to be a storage on the first floor of the mansion, from there the door of the hall is just 5 meters away via the corridor. If two of us run with full power, it’s fifteen — no, just ten seconds.*

Ronye and Tiese lifted the eyelids at the same time and stared each other's eyes.

No words were needed. They let go of hands and turned to the iron grid.

It would be difficult to destroy it with bare hands, but the swords’ sheaths, which were quite robust too, were left on the waists of both. Priorities of those did not reach the swords’ ones, but they should endure a single slash.

"... Hey, do you remember? The way Yujio-senpai and Kirito-senpai escaped from Cathedral's dungeon."

— Tiese suddenly whispered, Ronye blinked to that.

"Of course. They cut the divine iron chains, and using them broke the grid."

"When I heard that story, I thought, man our senpais are tough, but... no way I could ever imagine we would do the same thing."

"Me too."

A momentary smile wiped out, and Ronye with clasp removed the empty sheath from the sword belt with her left hand. Pased it to the right hand and raised it vertically. Tiese next to her made perfectly identical movement.

*I do not know what the emperor and Zeppos are doing to the goblins in the hall above. However, if we take the next step, we cannot lose even a second.*

*…………sorry.*

After apologizing to the sheath in my mind, Ronye sharply breathed in.

*One cannot use secret moves with a sheath, but I will just hit as much as I can.*

"Haaah!"

"Yaaaa!"

With the increasingly loud screams, two people sharply swung down empty sheaths performing Norkia style secret move "Lightning slash", also known as Incrad style secret move "Vertical".

It was probably an illusion that the sheath made of wood and leather felt wrapped in faint blue light. The two sheaths crashed into the steel grid and crumbled down to pieces with a tremendous pulsing sound.

Immediately afterwards, a grating of 2 mel height and 4 mel width split in two pieces, blew out of the framing and blasted against the other side of the aisle. Again, the thunderous roaring shook the whole dungeon.

*── Go!*

— though Tiese without saying a word, and to this thought:

*── Within ten seconds!*

— same way silently answered her Ronye jumping into the aisle.

Rushing into a secret door that was left open, they saw a small storage-like room. There were some leather bands looking like restraints on the right wall and strange shaped cutlery and glass containers on the left wall lined up. It was obvious how it was used, but pushing that out of heads, they searched around the floor relying on the weak light flowing in from behind.

Ronye's Sword of the Moonlight and Tiese's sword were carelessly thrown somewhere in the corner of the warehouse. Ronye who found the sword first picked up her beloved sword with her right hand and Tiese's sword with her left hand and threw it to her partner.

Three seconds have elapsed so far.

A stone stairway extended up in the front wall. Grasping the naked sword, they rushed up skipping five steps at a time.

The door at the end of the stairs was kicked open, revealing a storage room, bigger than the previous one. A large window, despite facing north, let in plenty of sunset-colored outside light, and it was much brighter than in a small basement room. The myriad of display shelves and armor stands around the floor and walls were all empty. When this villa was sealed off, the treasures must have been removed. The door that Ronye kicked off was disguised as a large shelf, and it would be difficult to find if one doesn’t know what to look for.

Seven seconds passed.

There were real doors: one on the western and one on the southern walls. Since the structure of the mansion was roughly sensed with incarnational sensing, they rushed over to the western door without hesitation and kicked it open again.

The door was blown away from the destroyed hinges and crashed against the opposite wall, but they ran ahead without worrying about it. Behind it there was a gorgeous hallway lasting long in both directions. The red wallpaper depicted a lily and a hawk.

The door of this corridor they we aiming at was just 15 mels to the left.

Eight seconds. Nine seconds.

Mustering together all the knight’s leg strength, Ronye, who had run through the corridor in two seconds, turned to the huge two-piece door and burst a kick in the center. Although it did not blow off as she, frankly speaking, expected, both pieces of the door opened wide with the momentum just barely insufficient to break them and revealed the interior scenery.

Ten seconds.

A vast room that would occupy about one-third of the first-floor area was dark. All the south side windows were covered with black curtains. It was not perfect darkness though because ten or so candles were lit in the center.

Candles were arranged in a circle about 2 mels in diameter, with three goblins lying in it. A black figure standing just outside the circle seemed to be casting some sort of an incantation. *Although we had no doubt that nothing good was happening here, now that’s surely ──*

Wide open Ronye’s eyes noticed a large jute bag rolled in the corner of the left side of the hall and a second black figure about to run there.

The shadow's identity would be Zeppos. There was no need to guess what was inside the bag.

*── Tiese!*

While calling her in her mind, Ronye stuck the left hand forward.

At the same time Tiese swapped sword and lifted the right hand that crossed Ronye's one.

"**System Call! Generate Thermal Element!**"

Ronye continued the sacred art Tiese began casting:

"**Form Element! Arrow Shape!**"

The five thermal elements Tiese produced instantaneously changed to five arrows according to Ronye's incantation. It was an advanced technique which allowed to shorten the activation time in half by sharing between casters the chant statements of element generation and forming, "tuned chant". To use it, Tiese and Ronye had to train together for a long time, beginning even before they became apprentice knights ── way before that, actually, since the time they were junior students. But now both "spiritual unity" and "tuned chant" techniques which even senior knights could succeed in with low probability, were available to them.

The two of them, after completing the element generation and formation in just two seconds shouted the last word aloud synchronously:

![Image](/Translate/Img/p269.jpg)

"**Discharge!!**" x2

The five glowing lines tore up the darkness.

The shadow in the black robe avoided the flaming arrows swooping ahead with a hum, by jumping backwards with a superhuman move. Arrows were crashing into the wall one after another, causing small explosions.

"Go, Tiese!"

— shouted Ronye while controlling the remaining two arrows.

Tiese removed her hand and rushed to the jute bag. In order to push the black robe — Zeppos further away, Ronye bent the flame arrows trajectory to follow him.

The fourth one also missed. But the fifth arrow hit the robe which flared up.

Zeppos silently dismissed of the robe and retreated further. At the same time, Tiese reached the jute bag and cut off the drawstring tightly tying its neck with the sword in her left hand.

"Shimosaki!"

— she shouted with a breaking voice, while inserting the left hand<sup><a href="#Prim2">2</a></sup> into the bag.

The young dragon she pulled out and embraced had some plume fallen out where the light blue feathers received a rough handling, but chirped a limp and quiet "Ku-ru-ru......" squeezing into the owner’s chest.

Feeling how the relief due to Shimosaki's safety is being overcome with anxiety for Tsukigake which has not returned yet, Ronye shouted loudly:

"Tiese, take Shimosaki to the safe place outside! Leave this here to me!"

"But...!!"

She resolutely insisted to her partner who was about to shake her head:

"Go!"

In order to help the goblins who seemed to lose consciousness, it is inevitable to fight with Zeppos and the emperor who continued to chant something unclear. It was impossible to fight while holding Shimosaki, and they would never be able to regain him if he’s taken away again.

"...... Got it, I’ll be right back!"

Having shouted this, Tiese swung the sword around herself. The nearby curtain was cut off and the glass window behind it crumbled with a loud noise.

Cutting through the darkness, the square of reddened sunset light burst into the hall. As if fearing the light of Solus, Zeppos who lost black robe retreated further.

What the man was wearing under robe was something very much resembling a physical restraint covering the whole body. A number of leather bands fixed together with countless rivets were wound tightly around the stick-thin limbs and body, and it wasn’t clear whether it was a protective gear or a kind of punishment.

And the skin looking through the gaps in the leather belts was also of a strange color. One couldn’t be certain watching it just under the reflected light of the setting Solus, but it’s bluish-gray color couldn’t be thought of as a human one.

*I think I saw this somewhere already......* While Ronye thought so, Tiese holding Shimosaki jumped through the broken window and escaped to the front yard. In order to hide Shimosaki in a safe place, she has run to the forest surrounding the mansion.

*It's two to one until the she comes back. Not that it’s impossible, but I am concerned about the extraordinarily long art that emperor Krueger continues to cast over goblins lying on the floor.*

She listened carefully to the weird voice, but could not understand the meaning of a single word of a chant. However, once the operation is completed, it is certainly that some bad things will happen.

Ronye tried to generate new thermal elements in order to interrupt the emperor's incantation while pointing the tip of the Sword of the Moonlight straight to Zeppos.

But just before that, Zeppos, who was retreating to the south window covered by the curtain, pulled out two daggers with almost no sound from the sheaths attached to the leather bands on both legs. The one in the right hand was slightly larger, but the blade in the left hand was covered with some green liquid.

*The blade in the left hand, same poison knife he pointed to Shimosaki back there in the dungeon.  
And perhaps the one in the right hand is the knife used to take old Yazen's life.*

While going around the candle circle in the center of the hall, Zeppos was getting closer and closer. The light of sunset flowing through the only window that has lost a curtain illuminated in red his face that was hidden under the hood until now.

There was no single hair on the man's head. The elongated face was also blue-and-black like the body, the bizarre pupils of small eyes glowed bright. This face didn’t remind her of anyone.

"...... you got out of the prison quite a bit sooner than expected, you know?"

— Zeppos whispered, with indifferent expression.

"Than what expected....... So... was it on purpose that you left the secret door open?"

The all skin-and-bones man produced a thin smile to Ronye's question:

"Oh, certainly. Would you think that emperor Norlangarth house's great chamberlain, being me, can allow for something as bad as forgetting to close the door?"

"Great chamberlain......!?<sup><a href="#Prim3">3</a></sup>"

As Ronye opened both eyes wide, Zeppos deepened his little smile.

Since she has never met a person who is emperor Norlangarth house's great chamberlain before or after the battle for the Imperial Palace, it was no wonder she didn’t recognize his face. But Ronye knew what happened to him. She surely heard what Human World Defense Army General Selrut had reported at the meeting after the chaos was suppressed.

"The emperor house's great chamberlain... should be dead. He refused to break up with the leaders of great aristocrats and was eliminated by the Human World army, that’s what I heard. "

"That was my duty, my pleasure. If it is for his Emperor's Majesty, I will die again and again, as often as I can."

Crossing his hands holding knives over his chest while saying so, Zeppos quickly glanced at the black robe man standing in the center of the hall.

Specifically, at the supposedly dead emperor Krueger Norlangarth who continued to chant the mysterious incantation. Moreover, unlike Zeppos, Ronye herself took the emperor's life. Her palms still remembered the feeling when the sword she grasped deeply pierced the right side of the emperor's chest.

*If they are not impersonators, it means that according to the words of Zeppos they have recovered from death. However, the resurrection of dead is something impossible neither for Kirito who has the greatest mind power of Human World, nor for Asuna who possesses the power of the goddess Stacia, nor for Ayuha Furia, the Sacred Art department head — nor for the half-god who continued to rule Human World for over 300 years, Highest Priest Administrator. I cannot believe that these two were truly resurrected. Something evil...... some unimaginably wicked trick should be used for that*, Ronye thought.

Perhaps, reading these thoughts from the expression of Ronye, Zeppos returned to the story and opened the crossed arms.

"To keep the doors of the dungeons open was, of course, to lure you here. Because thou is a perfect match for goblins combat training, without the need to pass that hidden passage....... "

"Combat training...... needn’t to pass...?"

While repeating after him with a hoarse voice, Ronye gazed at the goblins lying in the circle of candles. No matter how they looked, they were even smaller than Ronye, not mentioning tall Zeppos and the emperor, of course. *To begin with, what was the problem that made them to took you out of the dungeon?*

That was something she couldn’t understand, but one thing was certain — that it was necessary to stop the incantation as soon as possible. To do that, she first had to eliminate Zeppos.

"...... Enough of this wasteful talk. If you are resurrected from death, I will just drive you back to the deeps of the ground!"

— Ronye stated resolutely and held up her left hand.

*Zeppos has blades in both hands. He cannot use Sacred Arts this way. I’ll pause for an art, then will immediately shorten the distance and slay him.*

"**System Call! Generate Thermal Element!**"

Just like minutes ago, when she let Tiese to continue the incantation after the elements generation to maximize speed, she created 5 thermal elements. At the same time, Zeppos kicked of the floor and jumped over with two blades in hands. He seemed to think that since it was not a "tuned chant", the early attack would work, but that was a trap Ronye set up.

Ronye jumped back and shouted, leaving elements in the place of generation:

"**Discharge!!**"

Five thermal elements were discharged at once and exploded with tremendous roar.

It is necessary to process the element in order to hit the target of no fixed position by an attack technique. "**Arrow shape**" gives priority to linear penetrating power, "**bird shape**" gives an ability to pursuit, and there are many other processing formulae, but if enemies themselves come to the location of an element, they all are unnecessary. Just release it as it is at the moment of contact.

As Ronye planned, Zeppos was caught in the explosion. His leather bands which she couldn’t even call an armor won’t be able to negate the damage. Although thermal elements blast is a basic attack technique, the five elements blasted together have the power enough to completely erase the Life of even young and tough soldier.

*And even if you survive, you cannot move right away. So, I’ll slay you ── there!*

"Waaaa!!!"

With a high shout, she crushed the Sword of the Moonlight down towards the center of the black smoke cloud remaining in the air.

**Ga-ki~i~i~n**! The piercing metal sound echoed, and the sword stopped with the impact which was passed from the wrist to the right shoulder.

"............!?"

In front of astonished Ronye, Zeppos appeared from the dissolving smoke.

Most of the leather bands were burned black, and some parts torn apart. The most damaged was in the right chest, ragged leather bands were loosely dangling, and beneath the skin had a hollow enough to fir two fists. But that was it. Not a single drop of blood was flowing, and his right hand holding a large knife over his head firmly received Ronye’s sword.

*Impossible. He is standing despite the body is dented to the degree that the lungs and heart should collapse.* The full-body blow with the Sword of the Moonlight, which had the priority of the Divine Object class, delivered by Ronye, who despite being an apprentice, belonged to Integrity Knights, was stopped by one hand of a great chamberlain who wasn’t even a guard.

Standing close to her, Zeppos burst into laughter.

A small knife in his left hand, wet of poisonous green, was quickly protruding, and Ronye tried to avoid it by jumping backwards.

But she did not make it. The knife slid like a green snake through the air, reaching to her chest. The edge of the fluttering cloak is cut away without a sound ──

**Zag**!

— A damp sound reached Ronye's ears.

However, it was a piece of silver metal flying from behind — probably a stake generated from metallic element — that made the sound when it deeply pierced Zeppos' belly.

"Ronye!"

— Tiese shouted and jumped through the cracked window, grasping the naked standard sword:

"Get away from her!"

Following her friend’s voice, she retreated a step away from the poisoned knife which stopped just a few millis away from the solar plexus. Zeppos wiped out his smile and tried to catch up, but Tiese shouted again:

"**Discharge!!**"

Zeppos stared at the pointed tip of the second stake that flew with a humming sound, hit his back and protruded from the center of his chest. Blackened blood was splattered from the man's mouth.

*This time, he’s dead. There are no people living with the heart pierced with a 3 cen thick stake.*

Confident of that, Ronye stepped on the floor with both feet and brandished the sword to deliver the final slash.

"No, he still can move!"

Had Tiese not shout so, she might have been beheaded by a large knife Zeppos swept sideways at a horribly rapid speed.

"Wha............"

Astonished, Ronye bent her upper body to the limit. A blunt silver blade flew so close that her neck felt the pressure of the air it created.

Zeppos who swayed the knife also did not seem to be dead, but he was not intact either; he stopped following her and retreated with uneven steps. Stopped near the center of the hall and spread the two knives as if trying to protect the circle of candles.

Tiese ran through the hall’s space to a place by the side of Ronye, shouting with the sword directed to Zeppos.

"Ronye, he is not a human!"

"Eh... what do you mean...?"

As Ronye dashed a confused gaze back and forth to the broken window where she jumped in, Tiese added:

"I’ve found a heap of jute bags in the deeps of the forest. Inside them, was pure soil...... clay, stinking badly."

"Clay……?"

At the moment when she heard that word, Ronye's mind suddenly flashed.

Zeppos' gray skin. Even if he gets caught in the thermal elements explosion, it is just a hollow appearing in the body. Darkish blood.

Ronye saw a body with a similar texture at Obsidia Castle in Dark Territory. Not human. A huge monster suddenly appearing in the treasury store ──

"............ Minion!"

Tiese nodded deeply to Ronye’s panting voice, and Zeppos twisted his lips wet with black blood.

Minion. An artificial creature that could only be produced by Dark Territory Dark Arts Guild Masters. Although it accepts only simple instructions, it has enormous Life suitable for a large body and has high resistance to heat and cold. If Zeppos is a Minion made of clay rather than man, that could very well explain that the body only dented even though it was hit directly by five thermal elements explosion.

But that possibility suggested a new mystery.

"Minion...... It is a monster that cannot even speak. But he ...!"

When Ronye shouted that, Zeppos, with its belly and chest penetrated by the steel-element stake, said with thunderous voice:

"...... It was not just you guys from Axiom Church who were doing research on Sacred Art....... His Majesty Krueger...... no, those of the oldest and most precious bloodline of the four imperial houses have been running a countless study in order to complete a certain Art since hundreds of years ago..."

"The Four Emperors...... collaborated!?"

— this time Tiese exclaimed in surprise.

Ronye was appalled the same way. For Ronye born in the lower aristocratic house of the Norlangarth Northern Empire, the other three empires for the long time weren’t anything more than the far-away countries. It was only after she joined the Foreign World War when she learned the hard way that the Timeless Wall, which she thought was the end of the world, could be jumped over with a minimal effort, and that there is a vast world spreading outside of Human World.

*But Zeppos said that the emperors of the four empires had been doing research on Sacred Art for hundreds of years since a long time ago. Although it was a shocking story, it was not impossible come to think of it. If there were bills of passage even under the reign of the Highest Priest, it was possible to go and cross the Timeless Wall, and the four castles towering around the Cathedral were not farther away from each other than one kilolu by the sky. Even if it is unreasonable for the emperor himself to go back and forth, it is fully possible for someone else. For example, for a person in a position of a great chamberlain ──*

"What is that art!?"

Zeppos returned an unusual chuckle to Tiese’s request:

"Gy, gy-gy-gy...... What a foolish girl you are that you have not understand it yet. I’ll tell you...... it is a technique to acquire the privilege of gods monopolized by the Highest Priest, ‘Eternal life’.... "

"Eternal……"

"…life, is it!?"

Struck by the new shock, Ronye and Tiese just stood stock still.

Meanwhile, Zeppos’ body quivered with some sort of cheerful vibe, as he grabbed his narrow head with both hands holding knives:

"Gy-gy-gy....... We used all sorts of experiments to stop the natural decline of Life: all kinds of art, media from elixirs to even toxic poison sometimes. That dungeon where you were confined before. Lot of serfs died there dedicating their lives for this sublime purpose..."

A horrible monologue, followed by an annoying laughter.

Ronye frowned feeling deep grudge, and hatred, and jealousy in his voice and tenacious look.

*The one who became a great chamberlain of the imperial house, should have had a position and power comparable to the senior nobility. Such a person, what could he be jealous of the two who are barely apprentice knights?......* this thought really took her aback.

But it was not Tiese and Ronye as individuals that Zeppos was jealous of. It was the very existence of Integrity Knights. Immortals whose Life was frozen, living for eternity ──

For the emperor and senior nobility who were given the highest power a human may have and used to live a life full of luxury, there perhaps was nobody they could be more jealous of than the Highest Priest and the Integrity Knights overlooking the Human World from the top of white tower far higher than the Imperial Palace while enjoying their eternal lives, which they could never gain no matter how much desired. Moreover, because of the Taboo Index which forces submission to the Axiom Church, even emperor was not allowed to reveal antipathy.

However, Integrity Knights suffered the Integrity Knights’ troubles. Ronye knew that since entering Cathedral.

Those whose Lives have been frozen must go through repeated separation from the others who do not live indefinitely. For example, knights’ head Fanatio. She is forever young person who have lived for more than two hundred years, but Berchie, her son, is not the same. Unless someone resurrects the Life freeze Sacred Art lost with the death of the Highest Priest ── and unless Fanatio chooses to apply it to Berchie, her son will definitely get older than his mother and will eventually die. What an unbelievably cruel fate for both.

"Eternal life contradicts to the essence of the world."

— Ronye declared while restraining her anger hard, —

"It is absolutely forbidden to kill innocent people..... dozens of them, in search for such things......"

Zeppos’ face immediately distorted to a greater extent than ever before.

"Damned knights... how dare you saying such words at all?"

Black blood scattered from his mouth pronouncing curses.

*Even if Zeppos is minion as Tiese guesses, there is no guarantee that the body's contents are the same. It will be totally different from humans because it didn’t die even after the chest was damaged and belly were pierced with a thick stake, but it seems not to be just a clay of human type either. That blood at least appears to be flowing in the body, so if he loses all that blood he will die that time. The physique is much worse than of the real minion, so the amount of blood should be small too.*

Two of the three minions that appeared in the Obsidia castle were shattered in pieces by the fist of general commander Isukan, and the other one was split in two with the sword-like hand slash by the ambassador Scheta. With skills of Ronye and the other one, it was difficult to give a fatal injury ── Kirito and others would call it "**damage**", but if one can slip through two knives and slash one of the limbs then there is a winner.

But the problem was emperor Krueger whom Zeppos was trying to protect. Three minutes or more have passed since they broke into the hall, and he was still singing. The longer the Sacred Art is, the longer, more complex and more powerful effects is produced, and Ronye was not aware of any so long technique. The incantation of the Past Reflection art that Asuna used felt quite long too, but still it would have been only about two minutes.

*We cannot prolong the fight with Zeppos. Rather than waiting for death of blood loss, the battle must be resolved at shortest, and then we’d stop the emperor's incantation.*

"Tiese, when I activate the secret move, stop his movements with light element technique."

 — when Ronye whispered this, her friend instantly nodded.

The sword power, the sacred art power, and the incarnational power of the two were at the same levels. Tiese for sure would not want to impose a dangerous role on Ronye. However, there was a big difference between the two of them outside of their abilities. Tiese's Human World army standard sword must have had priority 25 and Ronye's Sword of the Moonlight’s priority was 39 — so it was Ronye who had to strike.

"...... certainly, neither Integrity Knights nor the Axiom Church may be absolutely correct."

— while raising her beloved sword overhead, Ronye shouted, —

"But even if we are sometimes not right, what you are doing here is definitely wrong whatever you say!"

As if the attitude of the owner was passed to it, the blade released a brilliant light blue shine. The moment Tiese began chanting the first line of Sacred Art, she kicked off the floor with the power of the whole body.

The invisible wings vigorously flapped behind her back, creating a tremendous acceleration. Instantaneously she shot through a distance of more than 10 mel and approached the enemy. Incrad style high-speed rushing technique, "**Sonic Leap**".

"You too shall be food for our ambitions, little girley!"

— Zeppos shouted out, grinning with pointed yellow fang-like teeth. He carelessly got better hold of the knives in both hands and tried to catch Ronye.

A pure white shine wrapped his evil words.

Three high-pitched pops overlapped with bang. Light bullets Tiese released had overtaken Ronye in the air.

Light elements were not as powerful as thermal or cryogenic elements, but with their overwhelming flight speed and hit accuracy, they were optimal to cause dizziness. Moreover, it became a counter anti-attribute to minion made with the power of darkness, so it was able to give some damage.

Purple smoke rose from the Zeppos’ face burned by intense light. The movement stopped only for a moment, but it was enough for Ronye.

The light blue flash passed diagonally between the two knives being swung down.

The Sword of the Moonlight bit deeply into the right shoulder of the former great chamberlain and exited the body under the left armpit. A cracked voice groaned from Zeppos’ mouth while he stiffened in a daunting pose.

"...... Krueger, ...... your...... majesty......"

The upper half of the split body slid to the lower left and dropped onto the carpet with a thud. Slightly behind, the lower body also collapsed to the knees.

Ronye avoided the black blood which gushed from the cut surface of the two body pieces by leaping beside.

The moment she was convinced that this time he’s dead, power left her entire body, but the battle had not ended yet. Before the incantation is completed, they had to also defeat emperor Krueger.

In front of her eyes, there was soundlessly swaying candles ring. Inside, the three mountain goblins laying, with their eyes closed. And beyond that, man in a black robe, keeping both hands up and continuing to cast the incantation ──

*If that is the case that the reborn emperor is also a minion, he cannot be defeated by a half-power attack. Like Zeppos, I need to break his body or behead him.*

Ronye brought her sword up again to activate the secret move.

The next moment, several things happened at the same time.

"Ronye!!"

— Tiese exclaimed behind her,

"Zeppos, do your duties!"

— The emperor roared interrupting the cast,

**Ga~ts**!!!

— a heavy impact hit Ronye's right foot.

A bit later, a tremendous pain ran up to her head. Looking down she saw Zeppos who became only a head and a left arm thrusting the knife deeply to the instep of the right foot. With blade glittering green.

Intense numbness followed the pain, and Ronye clenched teeth. The poison had to be dealt with before it spreads throughout the whole body, but there were many kinds of poisoning techniques, and it is not possible to judge which kind of sacred art should be used unless the identity of poison is defined.

"Kh...!!!"

While groaning, she cut Zeppos’ left arm off with a sword. Grabbed the guard of the poisoned knife and pulled it out of the foot. The blood streaming from the wound was already dark.

At the very least, in order to delay the circulation of the poison, Ronye generated five light elements, then deeply cut the leg above her right knee with a sword. Blood flowed again, but its color was still barely red. To allow the light elements into the wound, she converted them to fog using the "**Mist Shape**" command and blended into the blood.

*With this, poison and light should cancel each other to some extent, but to completely detox, it is necessary to use a special technique with medicinal herb that is contained in the carrying bag on the waist. The time’s running out, I have no choice but to use the first toxin decomposition technique which I’ll remember.*

Ronye was thinking so while trying to open the carrying bag with her left hand, but the sense of the fingertips was already dull and she could not unravel the strap. Also, the power was leaving from the left leg as well as from the injured right leg, her body violently shook and tilted ──

"Ronye!"

— Tiese, who ran from behind, supported collapsing Ronye. Carefully swinging the sword, she cut the head of Zeppos who was still watching from the floor.

The sharp metal sound **Kiin**! overlapped the dull sound something made of clay could produce. Zeppos’ head, which was split in two from the crown to the chin, apparently, had completely lost the Life this time, lost its shape and smoothly melted. The lower body that was kneeling nearby also turned into black mucus, and after it spread around the floor it quickly started to evaporate.

There was a strange thing falling in the place where Zeppos’ head disappeared. Silvery disk with petals of lily and feathers of a bird of prey ─ an emblem given to those serving Emperor Norlangarth house, petals and feathers representing the top-ranking ones.

The disk was cut in two pieces. The Tiese’s sword has broken it. A sort of purple smoke was rising from the cut, and soon it disappeared with a sound resembling a faint scream.

*This strange thing is the core of the mystery why Zeppos and the emperor who should have died were resurrected as minions. Perhaps, no, for sure there is something contained in the emperor’s head, which gives the character and personality to the clay body.*

"Tie......se."

Ronye called her best friend, resisting the numbness that was finally reaching the mouth.

*── Cut the emperor's head. This way you can defeat him.*

She wanted to continue, but her mouth wouldn’t move anymore. Tiese hugging Ronye with her left hand had thrown the sword on the floor and was searching hard in the carrying bag. Rather than defeating the emperor, she decided to cure Ronye. This decision cannot be blamed. If the situation is the opposite, Ronye would also do the same.

Behind the black hood drawn down to the eyes, Krueger thinly smiled. Nothing like a sorrow for Zeppos who was supposed to be his long-time supported to die for the second time reflected in that smile.

"**Connect All Circuit! Open Gate!**"

— the emperor raised both hands up to the limit, sharply bent the tall slender body, and shouted with a voice resembling a cracked bell.

Ronye did not understand the meaning of the phrase at all. But guided by some kind of instinct, she hardly turned the numbing neck.

The high ceiling of the large hall was painted black and there were decorative chandeliers hanging, that seemed to be expensive, but not lit. However, Ronye's eyes were drawn to the middle of the ceiling — to a circular hole just above the lying goblins.

*The diameter is about 30 cen. It wasn’t a neat job, the shape is distorted, and the wood is left scratched as it was. Perhaps it was a rough digging through the second-floor room floor with something like an ax.*

*For what such a thing could......* the confusion immediately changed to shivering.

Because something filthy-black was shaking at the back of the hole. Highly viscous, like mud. It closely resembled the clay-like material that the body of dead Zeppos was made of.

Ronye and Tiese both looked up and watched the black clay, or mucus, drooped down out of the hole. It moved as if being extruded with a strong pressure, or as if it crawling out by its own will.

Mucus swelled like a balloon, waved, wriggled — and burst with a horrible sound.
