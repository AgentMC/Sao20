# Afterword

Thank you for reading Sword Art Online 20 “Moon Cradle”.

19th volume had the same subtitle, but this is not a mistake or omission, it’s the just the same story title like it was in volumes 1 and 2 (Incrad) or volumes 3 and 4 (Fairy Dance). The Moon Cradle story of these two volumes is complete... for now, but it cannot be said that the incident has been completely resolved... There are various mysteries left, like who is the true mastermind of the incident, what about those red gems and so on, but actually, the battle between Kirito and the black emperors’ henchmen had continued for more than 100 years since then, and eventually lead to a decisive battle with the space monster Abyssal Horror (the scene appearing in the last chapter of volume 18), so when I think about writing it that far, just how many additional books would I need... (fear). In these two books, at least, I was trying to put some answers to the feelings of Tiese and Ronye, but it happened only halfway. I think that Tiese will be able to hear the Yujio’s voice through the Sword of the Blue Rose, but Ronye...... what will you do...? As long as there is her descendant Lauranei, she should have had a child one day, but right now, bound by her feelings to Kirito, she cannot imagine marrying someone else the future. However, Ronye is preparing to be appointed as a regular knight soon, she will become even stronger from now on, and I think that she will surely find the answer on her own, without listening to anyone else.

The story of Underworld is finished in the volume 20, and from volume 21 the stage returns to the real world, a new story of Kirito and Asuna being the high school students, not rulers, is scheduled to begin. I'm still unsure about some parts of that story, but we are expecting to deliver it soon, so please support the new volume as well. Also, I will do my best to progress the Progressive series!

On September 27, about two weeks after the publication of this volume, the BD & DVD of theatrical version<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup> will also be on sale. There is a rumor that there are more scenes there and the video overall is of higher quality as of the screening time...! Also, I am writing down a story to be published at a later date with the title "Cordial Chords". I hope you will enjoy it even if you did not read "Hopeful Chant" which was an extra to the premiere screening (and if you read it too), please do come and check it out!

That extra and this volume moved forward at the same time causing inconvenience to Abec-san, whom I want to say thank you for the beautiful & powerful illustrations that are better and better every time. To Miki-san, who remains a mystery for myself as for when does he sleep doing the CEO and editorial work concurrently, to associate Tsuchiya-san, to Adachi-san — thank you very much for your help. And thank you every one of readers as well, thank you for staying with SAO, which is finally going into the unknown zone!

A certain day in July 2017.
