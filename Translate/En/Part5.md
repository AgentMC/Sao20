# Part 5

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

From the 20th to the 30th floor of Central Cathedral there were residences of staff, Sacred Art masters and knights.

The room where Asuna and Kirito lived was in the southeastern corner of the of the thirtieth floor. Coincidentally, it was the same arrangement as the inn room in the South Centoria borrowed at six hundred sheers per day, but the sizes were not comparable.

Opening a thick door from the corridor, one first gets into an entrance room of about four tatamis size, and behind it, separated with another door, lies a huge living room of thirty tatamis size.

There are high windows with a grid on the south wall, from floor to near the ceiling, a complete kitchen and a bathroom are on the west side, and a spacious bedroom is on the east side. It is not as good as living room, but it is still about 15 tatamis<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>.

However, in Human World / Univerworld, the unit "tatami" was not used. To begin with, there were no tatami mats at least in Cathedral and North Centoria. The size of the boarded or tiled floor was only expressed in square mel and square kilolu, and they were also abbreviated as "he-mel" and "he-kilolu", respectively. According to this, is the living room size was about 50 he-mels.

*Cleaning this large one would be a serious task*...... would be a first thought when someone is introduced to the room the first time, but Underworld basically had only some dirt- or dust-like feeling effect, which did not require an entity object, and disappeared if one runs over it with a broom or a duster. Substantially it was retouching a digital image rather than cleaning, though this wasn’t something Asuna could say bluntly, but Kirito could very well.

Besides, there was another reason why cleaning is easy. 

Surprisingly, Cathedral...... no, entire Underworld had no toilets at all. Because the inhabitants of this world did not excrete even though they ate. Of course, same went for Asuna and Kirito who came from Real World but had to get accustomed to it; yet still, a thought of *where does all the stuff that allows to feel satiety go* can occur in one’s mind after eating too much.

Kirito, whose Underworld experience was longer than Asuna’s, said "The guys at RATH judged that simulating excretion is not necessary for training AI", but Asuna who had chosen human development science class at the high school in the real world could not agree with that idea. According to Freud's developmental theory, young children have a growing stage called "anal period", where learning confidence and controlling impulses and own sexuality is achieved through training to use a toilet...... that was what she remembered learning.

*Although it is unlikely that eliminating excretion is causing problems for Underworld people's personality, the doubt still remains. Underworld people say "shit" occasionally when cursing, but how do they recognize the meaning of that word? While I was thinking I would like to ask someone someday about it, more than a year has passed.*

*Precisely — one year, three months and sixteen days.*

Looking at a parchment calendar on the wall — it seems to have been used at older times, not made by Kirito or Asuna ─ which almost allowed to feel the rushing of time, she heard the door opening and closing in the entrance room.

The black hair of Kirito who came into the living room was still a little wet. It seems that he came back from the big public bath on the ninetieth floor in a hurry. In the past, we used to have the one who was faster to wait for another one at the branch point of the corridor, but after noticing other staff members hesitating to go in as I was standing there, I decided to return to our room without waiting.

"Sorry for keeping you waiting."

Said Kirito while approaching her, Asuna unwrapped a towel hanging on his shoulder and responded to greeting.

"You should wipe around your hair properly."

She wrapped his head with a towel and shook it with both hands. *There is no hairdryer in this world, but as you scrub hair with a dry cloth for a certain period of time, the moisture will leave, so after-bath hair care is easier than in the real world.*

While enduring without resistance, Kirito objected to her remark in somewhat childish tone:

"Asuna, it’s because you were faster over there... I wondered if I could catch up with you on the corridor..."

"Hey, it’s not me being fast, it’s Kirito-kun having a long bath. Today it was an hour."

"Oh, really?"

As soon as Kirito said so, the evening ten o'clock bell quietly echoed.

"Wow, seriously.... The nine-thirty bell, I missed it..."

"No way, I take it you were swimming in the bathtub?"

While asking a question she removed the towel and watched him with a serious look.

"S-such thing I wouldn’t do... except when I am alone......."

"Is that so? Here, sit on the sofa. "

She pushed his shoulders down and made him sit at the end of the large sofa in the middle of the living room. Asuna took up the brush she was using until a while ago from the low table and carefully combed the dry black hair. A brush with a silverwork on the ebony handle depicting a dragon that once used to live in the Eastern Empire — not a Western style dragon but an oriental dragon with elongated body — made the hair grow, because it was a magic item that made hair lustrous by simply combing. The two of them were firmly against any luxury, but this brush was given by knight chief Fanatio for the celebration of Vice-Prime Swordsman's 1st anniversary, and she sincerely appreciated it since then.

Kirito, whose head was entrusted to Asuna’s hands, suddenly said to himself:

"...... I wonder if I will be able to complete the clock soon."

"Same here. But you have already been prototyping it for a long time, is it... is it so difficult?"

"Yup. I need a lot of precision gears to move the hands properly, and gears in this world are in the hoisting device of the castle gate, or in the accelerator of the water turbine, they are good only for applying a big force...... So when I combined them, it does not work properly as a clock.... The stupid hour bell runs with the perfect precision, but the clock I made goes crazy and makes no sense..."

" I guess so."

A nod, and ponderingly:

"... Wait, I’ll ask Fanatio-san. Certainly, in the past there was a clock in this Cathedral, right? The Highest Priest-san made Bercouli-san’s sword out of it. So, who made it?"

"Ehm…well, I guess, it was in the Underworld from the very beginning. The place where this Central Cathedral is located was a small village three hundred years ago, where the staff of RATH brought up the first generation artificial fluctlights. It was just an object they set up in the village. "

"’The first four’......"

While these quiet words reminded of a story she heard from the RATH supervisor Seijiro Kikuoka back at the Ocean Turtle in Real World, Kirito thrusted his right hand into the brushed hair.

"Should the system console on the hundredth floor still function...... I’d call the object data of the clock and could just recreate it."

A bitter smile was an answer to these selfish words.

"Hey, if you can do such a thing, you don’t even have to make a clock as an object, you could just add a time display to the menu window...... to Stacia's window... but before that......."

*── you would be able to stop the Critical Acceleration Phase.*

Asuna left out these last words.

That moment Underworld was operating at a tremendous speed of five million times the reality. It could hardly be believed, but all the long days of one year and three months Asuna has been diving in that world took only about 8 seconds in the Real World. Imagining the huge amount of data that would be exchanged between the STL she was lying in and the fluctlight of her brain vaguely scared her. She feared that the brain could simply burn out someday.

However, if the system console is revived and it becomes possible for them to log out ── Asuna was not sure she could do it without hesitation.

Asuna and Kirito intervened in the governance system of Human World, entire Underworld, which brought enormous and rapid changes. They did not regret it, but the aftermath of the reforms still could be felt and the murder incident happened five days ago was a part of that. The two of them had a responsibility to witness the fate of the world, and should they have to logout without a reason, to look from the outside into Underworld watching the civilization collapsing, — that would be truly regretful.

Perhaps, feeling that there’s something that words can’t express, Kirito unexpectedly raised his hands from behind his head, grabbed Asuna’s body, pulled her forward turning around and sat on his knee.

"Kya~"

She exclaimed, protesting against the stuffed-toy-like treatment.

"Hey, careful!"

But Kirito behind her answered with a tone suggesting a wide grin.

"It's all right, I've supported you with incarnation."

"No problem then! Indeed, what other than superpowers remain to a human at a time of decline...."

"Decline is terrible."

In response, Kirito lightly hugged Asuna from behind.

That moment her body suddenly lose all the energy. Long ago ── seemed like in a previous life, after they just married in the floating castle Incrad, Asuna used to sit the same way on Kirito's knees many times every day, sometimes falling asleep.

A long, long time has passed since that time, but the feeling of being completely protected and that there is nothing to fear when he hugged her this way did not change at all. Holding the dragon-inscribed hair brush in both hands, she leaned against Kirito's chest and closed her eyelids.

*I want to fall asleep like this, and Kirito will carry me to bed even if I do, but I can’t do that. If I fall asleep, Prime Swordsman who feels uneasy today will get out of Cathedral and will depart to search for the three missing goblins.*

In the emergency meeting held in the afternoon, it was decided to issue an investigation order to the South Centoria administration in the name of Human World Union Council and the Integrity Knight group, but at that time the 5 pm bell rang, so it was the next morning to take actions. Moreover, since the official who appeared in the inn was probably a fake, even if the investigation in the administration is done, the outcome will most likely be "there was no order issued to transfer goblins and there is no such official." Asuna thought it was a bad idea to leave an entire day to the quick-moving killer for granted. Besides, it is unlikely that anyone but Kirito can search the whole Centoria and find goblins, so it could be a trap inviting Prime Swordsman just like in Obsidia.

And above all, Asuna was asked by an apprentice knight Ronye to keep an eye on Kirito, and she couldn’t afford failing the trust. *I must keep my promise to her.*

As soon as she thought of the serious face of Ronye who is worried of Kirito's welfare, the back of her chest hurt.

She knew about her feelings for long time already ── it became apparent even before the Human World Union Council was inaugurated, she has first noticed that the night she spent with the four of them, including knight Alice and Human World Defense Army general Solterina during the Foreign World War. But Asuna has never talked to Ronye about it since then.

Asuna was painfully conscious that the other one was still 17 years old and suffering from unrewarding feelings. But she did not know what to do with that.

This disconsolance she felt was the same as sometimes touched her in the real world.

Their friends of the real world who were tied to them by true bonds...... Lisbeth, Silica, Shinon, and Leafa. All of them had strong feelings to Kirito, but in front of Asuna they hid it or turned it into a joke. On the contrary, they used every opportunity to cheer and encourage Asuna.

As always, she was happy about it, but felt some pain as well. Thinking of Kirito, who did no effort to make up his mind in such a dangerous situation, only given her this bitter sensation.

But Kirito didn’t change much since the first time she met him in the first level of Incrad. With both hands widely open and accepting everything, never giving up. A person desperately continuing to level-up in the top ranking extremely dangerous labyrinth areas to finally lend a helping hand to fainting Asuna. And despite being an absolutely key player of the party in the following floor boss fight, he embraced hatred and antipathy to former beta tester choosing the road where he remained being called "beater".

This was exactly Kirito Asuna loved.

Therefore, when the two of them with Kirito got trapped in this world, Asuna for just a little, but felt something similar to a relief.

And in the final stage of the Foreign World War, her heart could not allow her to leave Kirito alone in this world, so she let only Integrity Knight Alice to escape to the real world and stayed in Underworld herself. No, after all was over, she understood that the option of logging out alone did not even appeared in her head at that time. So she did not think at all that it is a way to monopolize Kirito, however, after more than one year has passed, she felt no apology would be enough to resolve the ever-growing feeling of guilt before her friends and family whom she would never meet again.

Still ──

The feeling that in this world there is no need to spare his love with Lisbeth, Silica and others was constantly present in one corner of her heart.

Asuna put the brush on the knee, turned around to him and covered Kirito’s hands with both of her own.

The hug became a little stronger.

When they meet again at the "Altar of the End" at the southern end of the Dark Territory, Kirito was lying on top of the white stone steps, endless tears flooding from his eyes. Without asking, she knew that those were tears for the people whom they could not meet anymore.

A long time has passed from that time, but she rarely mentioned to Kirito any memories of the real world, their friends and families whom they would now bid eternal farewells. This, as well as reasons of this world, where there were too many things to think about, were why Asuna has still not managed to organize her emotions. Perhaps, for Kirito it was the same.

*That's why I want to face Ronye seriously. Rather than repeating the same mistakes as in the real world, I need to think about what I can do for her and what should I do. Always think this way ──*

"...... It is about time to sleep."

When Asuna whispered, Kirito responded "Right", just behind her right ear.

She tried to get off the knees, but the right hand of Kirito moved around her back just before that, and he lifted her up holding from both sides.

"Oh, ... wai...."

As soon as he unexpectedly moved her, the dragon-decorated hair brush that Asuna had on her body, rolled down. However, it stops silently around 50 centimeters above the floor, slid sideways and landed on the low table. Kirito caught it with the "hand of mind".

At that time, Asuna has practiced this supernatural ability that only Kirito and the senior knights could use, but her limit was to move a small Shear copper coin. However, when one can move things around so freely, the life seemed to be decreasing and she was a little bit afraid of that. But still, it surely could be of use for occasional housekeeping tasks like dishes and own rooms cleaning.

"...... it is not surprising anymore."

She glanced at Kirito sullenly, a mischievous smile returning to the face.

"I made an impossible today with the Past Reflection, it's about that, is not it?"

"It’s all about that."

While answering so, Kirito crossed the wide living room with a relaxed walk and opened the door of the bedroom again using the incarnation.

In the middle of a room nearly double of Asuna's own room in the real world, there was a bed one size larger than a king size. When she saw it for the first time, she complained to Fanatio, "That’s too luxurious ", who told her that this bed was brought in at the time when the 30th floor of the Cathedral was built, and it could not be taken out of the room unless it is already broken ─ a smart explanation to which there was nothing she could say. Besides, Asuna, who was somewhat fond of natural wooden furniture, could not deny that the massive black walnut solid headboard was keeping her glances.

According to Higa Takeru from RATH, Underworld used terrain and objects generated by the "The Seed" program transformed into a super-high-resolution "mnemonic-visual" data format. And since The Seed was a shrunk version of the Cardinal system that had run SAO, in a way it could be said that walnut trees growing in Underworld were of the same electronic genus as those of Incrad.

Asuna laid down on the right side of the bed, Kirito walked around the footboard and seated on the left side. His line of sight turned to light element lanterns shining softly in two places on the wall, and elements disappeared controlled by his incarnation. When the artificial light went out, the moonlight flowing in through the large window on the left side of Asuna shaded the room lightly blue.

Kirito then pulled up the quilt folded down at feet and covered Asuna tightly up till the neck. As if to make a bed for small child, he lightly tapped it from the top to the futon, and then also lied down.

"..... even when I fall asleep, have no hope of sneaking out."

Asuna whispered, feeling a calming drowsiness. From the right side, came a sigh of bitter smile.

"I won’t, indeed, in this large Centoria there’s no way to locate those goblins..."

![Image](/Translate/Img/p137.jpg)

"Fine, they will be found safely. Even for the criminals, to have another incident, preparations are necessary.... should be..."

Her right hand moved towards Kirito, resisting the drowsiness the body suddenly sunk into. Immediately a large and warm left hand found Asuna's hand and gently grasped.

Recently, when just two of them remained alone, she let herself to behave in a more childish way. It happened unintentionally and for no specific reason.

Perhaps the reason might be that the mental age of the two of them was reversed.

Asuna's birthday was September 30, 2007. Kirito's birthday was October 7, 2008. Asuna was one year older all the time, but Kirito spent two years eight months of life in Underworld where time has been accelerated before Asuna dived. However, he was in unconscious state for half a year of which he did not have memory. Therefore, even if six months are deducted, Kirito is now one year and two months older than her by mental age.

There were few opportunities to be conscious of it in an everyday life, but in small gestures and words they exchanged when left alone, she didn’t feel anymore that immaturity Kirito of the Incrad era sometimes had. The accumulation of that sensation might make Asuna childish.

Come to think of it, when she came across Kirito at SAO, he was high school student of only 14 years old. And Asuna was also a high school third grader just before taking the exam. The two who decided to unite in the course of action, communicated in a childish way with each other.

Recollecting memories of that period that seem to be so long time ago, Asuna fell into the deep and soft sleep.

Despite the actual size of more than 80 m<sup>2</sup>, it is significantly larger than the “default” size for a housing 2 in Japan (about twice as larger). For example, according to Vol.18 Epilogue 6, Higa Takeru’s apartment in Higashgotanda had 8-tatami main room, which corresponds to a western-style bedroom size.
