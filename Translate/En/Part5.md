# Part 5

<!--<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>-->

From the 20th to the 30th floor of Central Cathedral there were residences of staff, Sacred Art masters and knights.

The room where Asuna and Kirito lived was in the southeastern corner of the of the thirtieth floor. Coincidentally, it was the same arrangement as the inn room in the South Centoria borrowed at six hundred sheers per day, but the sizes were not comparable.

Opening a thick door from the corridor, one first gets into an entrance room of about four tatamis size, and behind it, separated with another door, lies a huge living room of thirty tatamis size.

There are high windows with a grid on the south wall, from floor to near the ceiling, a complete kitchen and a bathroom are on the west side, and a spacious bedroom is on the east side. It is not as good as living room, but it is still about 15 tatamis<sup><a href="#Prim1">1</a></sup>.

However, in Human World / Univerworld, the unit "tatami" was not used. To begin with, there were no tatami mats at least in Cathedral and North Centoria. The size of the boarded or tiled floor was only expressed in square mel and square kilolu, and they were also abbreviated as "he-mel" and "he-kilolu", respectively. According to this, is the living room size was about 50 he-mels.

*Cleaning this large one would be a serious task*...... would be a first thought when someone is introduced to the room the first time, but Underworld basically had only some dirt- or dust-like feeling effect, which did not require an entity object, and disappeared if one runs over it with a broom or a duster. Substantially it was retouching a digital image rather than cleaning, though this wasn’t something Asuna could say bluntly, but Kirito could very well.

Besides, there was another reason why cleaning is easy. 

Surprisingly, Cathedral...... no, entire Underworld had no toilets at all. Because the inhabitants of this world did not excrete even though they ate. Of course, same went for Asuna and Kirito who came from Real World but had to get accustomed to it; yet still, a thought of *where does all the stuff that allows to feel satiety go* can occur in one’s mind after eating too much.

Kirito, whose Underworld experience was longer than Asuna’s, said "The guys at RATH judged that simulating excretion is not necessary for training AI", but Asuna who had chosen human development science class at the high school in the real world could not agree with that idea. According to Freud's developmental theory, young children have a growing stage called "anal period", where learning confidence and controlling impulses and own sexuality is achieved through training to use a toilet...... that was what she remembered learning.

*Although it is unlikely that eliminating excretion is causing problems for Underworld people's personality, the doubt still remains. Underworld people say "shit" occasionally when cursing, but how do they recognize the meaning of that word? While I was thinking I would like to ask someone someday about it, more than a year has passed.*

*Precisely — one year, three months and sixteen days.*

Looking at a parchment calendar on the wall — it seems to have been used at older times, not made by Kirito or Asuna ─ which almost allowed to feel the rushing of time, she heard the door opening and closing in the entrance room.

The black hair of Kirito who came into the living room was still a little wet. It seems that he came back from the big public bath on the ninetieth floor in a hurry. In the past, we used to have the one who was faster to wait for another one at the branch point of the corridor, but after noticing other staff members hesitating to go in as I was standing there, I decided to return to our room without waiting.

"Sorry for keeping you waiting."

Said Kirito while approaching her, Asuna unwrapped a towel hanging on his shoulder and responded to greeting.

"You should wipe around your hair properly."

She wrapped his head with a towel and shook it with both hands. *There is no hairdryer in this world, but as you scrub hair with a dry cloth for a certain period of time, the moisture will leave, so after-bath hair care is easier than in the real world.*

While enduring without resistance, Kirito objected to her remark in somewhat childish tone:

"Asuna, it’s because you were faster over there... I wondered if I could catch up with you on the corridor..."

"Hey, it’s not me being fast, it’s Kirito-kun having a long bath. Today it was an hour."

"Oh, really?"

As soon as Kirito said so, the evening ten o'clock bell quietly echoed.

"Wow, seriously.... The nine-thirty bell, I missed it..."

"No way, I take it you were swimming in the bathtub?"

While asking a question she removed the towel and watched him with a serious look.

"S-such thing I wouldn’t do... except when I am alone......."

"Is that so? Here, sit on the sofa. "

She pushed his shoulders down and made him sit at the end of the large sofa in the middle of the living room. Asuna took up the brush she was using until a while ago from the low table and carefully combed the dry black hair. A brush with a silverwork on the ebony handle depicting a dragon that once used to live in the Eastern Empire — not a Western style dragon but an oriental dragon with elongated body — made the hair grow, because it was a magic item that made hair lustrous by simply combing. The two of them were firmly against any luxury, but this brush was given by knight chief Fanatio for the celebration of Vice-Prime Swordsman's 1st anniversary, and she sincerely appreciated it since then.



## Footnotes:

1. <a name="Prim1"></a>This should be perceived as “posh”. Despite the actual size of more than 80 m<sup>2</sup>, it is significantly larger than the “default” size for a housing 2 in Japan (about twice as larger). For example, according to Vol.18 Epilogue 6, Higa Takeru’s apartment in Higashgotanda had 8-tatami main room, which corresponds to a western-style bedroom size.
